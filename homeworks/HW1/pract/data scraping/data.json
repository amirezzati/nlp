Through the session, Stephanie discussed a variety of topics and issues relating to digital maturity and building digital maturity roadmaps.\nTo begin, she shared a brief introduction: \u201cIdeal Health is\u00a0a HIMSS technology health partner, and we support trusts in identifying their current state of digital maturity and in building roadmaps so that they can take action on the assessments that have been taken. Today, I\u2019ll be exploring the current assessment methods, and demonstrating how they can be used to articulate priorities within your organisation.\u201d\nThe digital transformation lifecycle\nStephanie took the audience through the digital transformation lifecycle and the digital maturity models underpinning that transformation, focusing on INFRAM, the infrastructure adoption model; EMRAM, the electronic medical records adoption model; and AMAM, the analytics adoption model.\n\u201cPeople tend to use INFRAM just before they undergo large EPR transformations or anything that\u2019s going to be particularly challenging on their infrastructure,\u201d she said, \u201cand they do that so that they can understand what the gaps are and how they can close them.\n\u201cThey use EMRAM just before and also just after EPR implementation, to understand their level of digital maturity with regards to medical records; to see how it\u2019s being improved, and to understand what areas to focus on post-implementation.\u201d\nThe analytic model AMAM, meanwhile, \u201cbuilds on the fact that you now have a rich data source; your EPR build will be used more and more for clinical decision support, and that data then offers you opportunities to be able to look at the operations and outcomes of health delivery.\u201d\nStephanie likened this to \u201cno longer having to look in the rearview mirror\u201d at last month\u2019s activity reports to understand what is happening, noting that it enables you to start using data to\u00a0understand what will be happening in a much more predictive way.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll also be able to look at data sets that can be combined to improve your understanding, like weather reports or reports from social services about resource availability, or information around the locale of your hospital in terms of sporting events,\u201d she highlighted. \u201cYou can bring that data together to predict what the impact on the hospital will actually be. This can then be used, for example, to look at your staffing model, perhaps in your emergency department \u2013 and as the use of your information improves, you\u2019ll be able to look at dashboards and start predicting what needs to be done in the near future.\u201d\nDigital maturity, digital capabilities framework and\u00a0HIMSS \nStephanie shared an analogy for the difference between maturity and capability, stating that whilst capability allows you to boil an egg, maturity enables you to master the art of baking. In order to make this leap, she continued,\u00a0new processes, upgraded tools, and new skills would be required.\n\u201cIn the digital healthcare context, being in possession of a more capable EPR does not, of itself, mean that you\u2019re operating at a higher level of digital maturity,\u201d she pointed out.\u201dYou also need to develop processes, skills and governance to ensure the system has been fully adopted to claim that maturity.\u201d\nStephanie went on to discuss some of the differences between the digital capabilities framework (DCF) and HIMSS, including that the DCF is an input-focused model, whereas the HIMSS maturity model is output-focused.\nExpanding on her point, Stephanie explained that \u201cinput-focused\u201d tends be asking what the system can do; what are its capabilities? For example, can the EPR automatically detect escalating risk and deteriorating patient conditions and push the relevant alerts, notifications or tasks through to clinicians?\n\u201cHIMSS tends to focus on the outputs \u2013 it\u2019s looking for the effect of those inputs, covering things like risk of sepsis, risk of medication error,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be a nuance, but I think it\u2019s important that digital maturity tools remain focused on the impact that they have in healthcare and the improvements that they can bring to patients, rather than improvement on the system for system\u2019s sake.\u201d\nFor DCF, Stephanie continued, level of adoption is implied by three categories of capability: core capabilities or minimum capabilities; transformation capabilities, which may be functionally available but are not always in widespread use; and innovation capabilities, which are the aspirations of a digitally mature system.\nIn HIMSS, by contrast, adoption is \u201ca key empirical measure linked to the maturity stage,\u201d Stephanie stated. \u201cFor example, what they\u2019re actually looking for would be the percentage of clinical documentation that is recorded as structured documents; so it is much more explicit about the expectation of the usage of the system.\u201d\nDCF\u2019s areas of focus include storage and management of records, assessments and plans; transfers of care; diagnostics management; decision support tools; and remote and assistive care. HIMSS, meanwhile, is broken down into five domains, including data capture and HIE; patient engagement; analytics and outcomes; resilience management; and clinical user adoption.\nStephanie noted that selecting which model will work best for your organisation will depend on what you want to achieve. She shared her views that HIMSS \u201cexcels\u201d at the analysis of factors constraining digital maturity, at building digital maturity roadmaps; and as an internationally established comparison. For DCF, she commented that its strengths lie in demonstrating the range of capabilities you currently have and/or those you seek to address by an upcoming investment, and the fact that it is\u00a0closely linked with the What Good Looks Like framework.\nDigital maturity assessments\nStephanie went on to look at digital maturity assessments and highlighted what these assessments actually reveal. Presenting an example taken from the HIMSS EMRAM assessment, Stephanie took us through the best ways to identify priority areas of focus for levelling up, focusing on the areas preventing an organisation from meeting the requirements for that next level.\n\u201cAn example of that would be an organisation which hasn\u2019t met the 70 percent requirement for clinical user adoption, but has met requirements in every other area \u2013 we would look first at getting that metric up to the necessary level, and what steps we could take to achieve that,\u201d she said.\nSummarising her presentation, Stephanie shared some key takeaways on digital maturity. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a number,\u201d she stated. \u2018The most important thing you will get from doing your digital maturity assessment will be your roadmap, because it helps you to identify where to go next. Analysing the results you will get is not straightforward, and it\u2019s something which organisations do benefit from having a technology partner to help with; but it is addictive once you start understanding what\u2019s holding you back.\u201d\nMany thanks to Stephanie for sharing her insights.\nTo find out more or to contact the Ideal Health team, visit their website here.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire, mental health support website in Portsmouth, \u2018DadPad\u2019 app in Coventry, and more", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/22/news-in-brief-anxiety-app-for-children-in-gloucestershire-mental-health-support-website-in-portsmouth-dadpad-app-in-coventry-and-more/", "content": "\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the health tech news stories that have caught our eye in March.\nMy Medical Record integrates with NHS App at University Hospital Southampton\nUniversity Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust has announced the integration of its My Medical Record platform with the NHS App, meaning patients can now use the app to view outpatient appointments and referral information.\nPatients will still be able to view appointment details, documents, blood test results, and condition specific content from the My Medical Record platform. They can also use the service to update details about their height, weight, and blood pressure, as well as to add notes relating to their condition and overall health.\nChildren given free access to app to combat anxiety in Gloucestershire\nChildren in Gloucestershire are being given free access to a new app designed to help combat anxiety, with the Lumi Nova app developed for children aged 7-12 with the aim of offering them a \u201cfun, safe, and interactive environment\u201d to access anxiety support.\nAvailable on Apple and Android devices, the app is free to download for anyone living in Gloucestershire.\nBenedict Leigh, director of integrated commissioning for NHS Gloucestershire, said: \u201cWe are delighted to offer children in Gloucestershire, and their parents, the chance to use Lumi Nova. We know there can be moments in every child\u2019s life where they feel uncertain, scared or worried. Lumi Nova is a great way to help children with feelings of anxiety; whether that is being scared of the dark, worried about school or not being able to sleep. With Lumi Nova children can select from a number of different challenges within the app which offers support to meet their needs. We\u2019ve seen a great number of sign ups in the first six weeks and we\u2019ve had positive feedback.\u201d\nDadPad app for new and expectant dads relaunched in Coventry\u00a0\nThe DadPad app, which offers support and guidance for new and expectant dads, has been relaunched in Coventry to help dads \u201cprepare for and transition into new parenthood\u201d.\nCovering things like nappy changing, safer sleep, available support, infant feeding and first aid, the app is intended to \u201cdevelop a relationship of trust and confidence between dad and the frontline perinatal healthcare professionals, bringing dad into settings that he\u2019s traditionally and historically been excluded from\u201d.\nThe app\u2019s latest developments have included a more user-friendly interface, and a community group area to help dads connect with others in their area.\nNew platform empowering children and young people in Coventry and Warwickshire\nA new Positive Pathways platform has been launched in Coventry and Warwickshire, offering children and young people the opportunity to access activities in their local area, support with skills and employability, and the ability to connect with groups and services in their community.\nAs well as offering these functionalities for young people, the platform also supports parents in getting involved in their children\u2019s health, and supports health professionals who are working with young people who may be struggling to access support, streamlining referral processes to \u201cnon-medical support services\u201d.\nLyn Ranson, clinical consultant lead West Midlands Trauma Vanguard at NHS Coventry and Warwickshire, called the platform \u201ca valuable tool for children and young people and professionals alike\u201d and said: \u201cThe platform represents a repository of opportunities and activities in an easy-to-use format to foster positive outcomes for the children and young people across Coventry and Warwickshire. In addition, the Vanguard commissioned the development of a look up tool for Warwickshire to compliment the already established navigation tool in place for Coventry. This resource is a fantastic example of how the Vanguard project is promoting a person-first approach and empowering our local young people to choose how they access support that is right for them.\u201d\nNew website for mental health support in Portsmouth\u00a0\nA new website is offering Portsmouth residents the chance to access mental health support \u201cbefore they reach crisis point\u201d, building on work already done on the Portsmouth Mental Health Hub in 2023 to provide telephone support for those aged 16 and over.\nThe Hub has already taken over 3,000 calls, with 1,500 residents being referred for further support. It is hoped that the website will add an additional way for patients, friends and families to find support for themselves or those close to them.\nAbi Clarkson, head of access at Solent NHS Trust, said: \u201cWe are really pleased to be expanding our mental health offer with the website \u2013 giving people the choice of how they seek mental health support as we know that people\u2019s preferences are different, especially when taking that brave first step. Throughout people\u2019s lives, we fully recognise that many situations can contribute to poor mental health such as financial, housing and relationship matters. That is why we encourage the city\u2019s residents to reach out to the Portsmouth Mental Health Hub by phone or online to get help to improve their mental health before they reach crisis point.\u201d\nOur last news in brief article featured a VR app for blood transfusion training, cyber security e-learning, online kidney donor education, and more.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026SBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m tender for long-term digital transformation partner", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/22/hywel-dda-local-university-health-board-publishes-75m-tender-for-long-term-digital-transformation-partner/", "content": "\nHywel DdaHywel Dda Local University Health Board Local University Health Board has published a tender worth an estimated \u00a375 million for a digital transformation strategic partner to support them in planning, accessing and managing digital ambitions by leveraging the capacity and expertise of both the health board and the partner.\nIt is hoped that the long-term partnership will \u201csignificantly\u201d accelerate the pace of the health board\u2019s digital response and priorities, with specifications including that the partner be flexible in nature; that they will provide \u201cstable and sustainable\u201d solutions; and that they will work in an integrated way with the health board\u2019s internal teams.\n\u201cA digital transformation strategic partner will therefore put in place much needed flexibility to sustainably manage changing peaks and troughs of future projects, responding to funding opportunities more quickly,\u201d the notice states, \u201cthereby reducing over time the use of ad-hoc contractor support and achieving more sustainable outcomes for patients/citizens.\u201d\nThe contract is expected to run over ten years, lasting until an estimated date of 23 April 2034.\nThe closing date to apply is 23 April 2024 at 12pm; click here to access the notice in full.\nIn other news from Wales, earlier this month we looked into the new primary care strategy from Digital Health and Care Wales, spanning 2024-2027 and placing emphasis on the development of a digital futures team to help shape technology choices as well as the enhancement of researching and reporting capability.\nWe also covered the\u00a0draft organisational strategy for 2024-2030 from Digital Health and Care Wales, which sets out strategic objectives for digital across health and care, including infrastructure, data platform, open architecture, digital services, digital health and care records, research, innovation and workforce.\nIn other contract news, HTN reported on the news that the New Victoria Hospital in London has signed a contract with MEDITECH to provide its web-based electronic health record; and that Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust awarded a contract for digital neurodevelopment assessments with an estimated value of \u00a3749,000 to online mental health, autism and ADHD service provider Healios.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Interview: \u201cA digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\u201d Jessie Dhaliwal, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/21/interview-a-digital-nurse-is-still-a-nurse-at-heart-jessie-dhaliwal-leeds-teaching-hospital/", "content": "\nFor a recent interview, we spoke with Jessie Dhaliwal, a digital nurse at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and Shuri Fellow, about her work on digital and transformation in Leeds.\nJessie started out by sharing with us a little bit about her role and background, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been a registered paediatric nurse for five years now, and previously I was a children\u2019s nurse clinically in a district general hospital. I support digital implementations \u2013 my role focuses on providing that bridge between the tech people and the clinical team, ensuring our systems are clinically safe and user-friendly for our clinicians.\u201d Sometimes, she shared, she might be attending a meeting that isn\u2019t necessarily digital in nature; but upon hearing the challenges that people are facing, she can consider how a digital element might support people in tackling that challenge.\n\u201cOther important aspects of my role as a digital nurse include\u00a0promoting innovation and service improvements using digital technologies, supporting data collection and analysis, guiding teams to use data to improve patient care, and supporting better teamwork and staff satisfaction,\u201d she added.\nJessie also emphasised her passion for digital inclusion, supporting clinicians to use digital tools and promoting training. \u201cIf there are two people on a ward that need us to sit down with them and spend a bit longer showing them that system so that they feel comfortable with it, then we make it happen.\u201d\nGetting into digital\nWhat did Jessie\u2019s path into a digital nursing career look like, and what attracted her to the role?\n\u201cI trained at Liverpool John Moores; we had a really small cohort but it was great. All of our placements, with the exception of the adult placement we had to do, were at Alder Hey. They have a full EPR system there \u2013 I was fully trained on that system, never needed a pen, it was fantastic. When I got a job in a trust that was predominantly paper-based, it was a really difficult transition. There was really limited support. My experience of learning to be a nurse was completely different and a lot more efficient to the way in which I was expected to work in reality \u2013 that was what made me realise that I wanted to get into digital, to help bring those efficiencies in.\u201d\nDuring and after COVID, Jessie said, challenges such as staff shortages made her feel that she was not able to do as much for her patients as she wanted to. She felt that it might be worthwhile\u00a0moving into a position where she could make a bigger difference by helping other staff members to do more with digital.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research on how children and young people transition into adult services,\u201d Jessie noted. \u201cOften they really struggle. I want digital solutions that our patients can use to get more involved in their care; for example, even at three or four years old, they could point to an emoji on a screen to show us what level of pain they are in. As a student, I\u2019d often see the nurse speaking to the parent; but I think we should be empowering young patients, and that digital could make a big difference in terms of doing that.\u201d\nWorking with the play team in a previous role, Jessie explained she had learned ways that digital tech could help patients, including the use of virtual reality in reducing pain and making hospital seem less scary for children and young people.\n\u201cI did a bit of research and found the Shuri fellowship \u2013 I applied for it on a whim, not really thinking I would get in, and it was absolutely fantastic,\u201d she shared. \u201cWe shadowed digital clinical leaders in lots of different clinical digital teams and got some coaching which was amazing. I grew this very supportive digital network, which then supported me to get into this role.\u201d\nPriorities in digital nursing\nWe moved on to ask Jessie about her priorities as a digital nurse at Leeds Teaching Hospitals. She shared a few areas of priority, including improving staff retention, and the Visualise, Optimise, Digitise (VOD) programme, which looks at reducing the documentation burden and using digital to reduce duplication. Jessie developed the artwork for the programme, focusing on delivering visual bite-sized information for staff to make it easier to digest and to encourage engagement.\n\u201cAnother priority is supporting a culture of research and innovation \u2013 making sure that we\u2019re using information and insights in the work that we do, like the creation of new digital systems, forms or documentation. Before developing those programmes, we want to make sure that they have the potential to provide the data that matters to a nurse, or to the managers.\u201d\nJessie also talked about another priority around the effective development and deployment of new assets, highlighting the work she has been involved in on building the digital advocates programme, which makes sure that new initiatives aren\u2019t \u201ctop-down\u201d, but that instead end users can get involved in helping to create and direct them.\n\u201cWhen it comes to delivering the financial plan, I\u2019m a waste reduction champion,\u201d she shared. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at using digital systems to reduce waste, which can bring it all together in one place, to be accessed from wherever you are.\u201d\nUltimately, Jessie said, a main priority is to bring the trust together, using the same tools. She shared that the team has recently run an \u2018Office 365 day\u2019, with attendance of around 100 people from across the trust, to show what those tools can offer beyond the basics. \u201cIt\u2019s about empowering our staff and ward managers to use the tools within Office 365 for quality improvement,\u201d she said.\nDigital nursing, Jessie reflected, \u201cis not all about the technical side of things. There is management and data work involved \u2013 for example, sourcing specific data so that we can demonstrate what we are doing to the CQC. But from my perspective, I\u2019m still looking after my patients; I actually need that data so that I can assess if something is working for my patients or not, or if I need to implement something to make it better.\u201d\nShe added:\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that students know what a clinical digital nurse is, so they know that they are a nurse at heart. I would like more people to know about the opportunities that are out there, and what could be possible for them in the future.\u201d\nSkills and support for digital nursing\nWhat skills would benefit someone looking to get into a similar role in digital nursing?\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about being a compassionate nurse who wants to do better for our patients and our colleagues, that is the centre of it,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing digital in that sentence on purpose, because I don\u2019t think there needs to be. It\u2019s about being passionate about quality improvement, being a good advocate, communicator, and educator. I also think being a dreamer is important, and not being afraid to think outside the box. Think of the most incredible, best way something could ever be, and work from there.\n\u201cAlso, it\u2019s worth saying \u2013 you don\u2019t need to know how to code! We are nurses, we aren\u2019t technical experts on digital, and\u00a0we don\u2019t have to be.\u201d\nOn areas where digital nurses could benefit from more support, Jessie talked about her experience with the mentor and buddying scheme at Leeds, which has given her \u201ca wealth of information and learning\u201d.\nShe highlighted that there are gaps in available support, with a lot of support tending to focus on people at the very early stages of their career and also support for those in more senior positions. There is less support available for people in the \u2018middle\u2019, Jessie pointed out, with a need for additional support\u00a0for senior band five and six nurses in terms of getting into digital.\n\u201cI have an idea \u2013 you could get a digital penpal which sees you buddy up with a band six from another trust and work together,\u201d she shared. \u201cMaybe you could do trust swaps, do a week in each others roles. There could be a lot more cross-working across trusts, which would really help in sharing knowledge and best practice, and it would help with having the support of someone alongside you.\u201d\nFinally, we asked Jessie what advice she would give to somebody looking to get into digital working.\nShe said: \u201cMy top advice would be to join the digital shared decision making council. That has been the biggest thing for me, I absolutely love it \u2013 they have monthly meetings and there\u2019s a WhatsApp chat which is great for networking and support. Every month people share what they\u2019re up to, and if someone else is working on something similar, then they can link up together. You don\u2019t have to be digital already, it\u2019s just to get an idea of what\u2019s going on and attending conferences and webinars around digital.\n\u201cAlso, I\u2019d encourage people to apply for scholarships and get involved in supporting your digital team, or in a project in your area.\u201d\nTwitter/X has been \u201cinvaluable\u201d in her experience in terms of networking and progressing in her career, Jessie added.\n\u201cFinally, just something I try to live by: be a rebel! Obviously not if it affects clinical safety, but when it comes to having ideas and putting things out there, I definitely think it can be worthwhile.\u00a0We aren\u2019t going to get anywhere by doing the same thing.

He shared insights into how their flagship product, OX. assisted reproduction (OX.ar), came about, how it is being rolled out and how it is used in practice.\u00a0\u00a0\nJohn emphasised the distinct advantages of OX.ar as being fully cloud-native, contrasting it with legacy systems that have merely transitioned to the cloud without fully embracing its capabilities.\u00a0\nHe noted: \u201cBy fully leveraging cloud technology, OX.ar ensures inherent security and integrates seamlessly with Microsoft\u2019s comprehensive security model. This is crucial for connecting multiple clinics and securely sharing patient records with precise control.\u201d\u00a0\nIn his presentation, John outlined OX.ar\u2019s five core principles, which are pivotal to its design and functionality:\n\nEnhancing patient experience and clinical outcomes\u00a0\n\n\nAlleviating the workload on healthcare staff\u00a0\n\n\nEmpowering individuals with direct access to information and services\u00a0\n\n\nGuaranteeing secure access to patient information\u00a0\n\n\nLeveraging digital technology to boost health and care productivity \u00a0\n\nHe also stressed the importance of continuous, small improvements in daily operations, which collectively lead to significant enhancements across the clinic.\nJohn went on to share insights from initial research interviews, which led to categorising the platform\u2019s functionalities into three main areas:\n\nPatient onboarding and assessment\u00a0\n\n\nScheduling and conducting initial consultations to develop personalised treatment plans\u00a0\n\n\nOngoing monitoring, outcomes tracking, and regulatory reporting\n\nThis structured approach underscores OX.ar\u2019s commitment to streamlining healthcare processes, ensuring both efficiency and security throughout the patient\u2019s journey.\nThe patient journey\u00a0\nThe assisted reproduction journey involves a diverse group of participants, including patients, partners, donors, and others. OX.ar simplifies this intricate pathway with a secure and robust data model that effectively orchestrates every facet of treatment. This includes patient engagement, scheduling appointments, digital consent for HFEA and clinic-specific forms, as well as seamless integration with both internal and external laboratories. It also encompasses referral management and grants access to a dedicated patient portal.\u00a0\nFrom a security standpoint, OX.ar ensures ease of access and administration by allowing authentication via existing Microsoft Active Directory User IDs. Moreover, it has been implemented on the NHS national tenant, enabling the use of NHS net user IDs. This approach streamlines the management of security protocols and information access, utilising familiar and trusted capabilities.\u00a0\n\u201cOur solution not only addresses a specific challenge but is also versatile enough to be customised for various needs,\u201d stated John.\u00a0\nDesigned with digital transformation at its core, OX.ar revolutionises the complete experience for both patients and clinicians. It enhances patient interactions, simplifies the scheduling of appointments, and expedites the processing of test results, among numerous other features.\nOrigins of the solution\nJohn delved into the origins of OX.DH, showcasing its strong connections with prestigious entities like the University of Oxford and its status as a Microsoft partner. He also mentioned its inclusion in the NHS Tech Innovation Framework, which is instrumental in introducing new technology to primary healthcare. These collaborations highlight OX.DH\u2019s dedication to innovation and enhancing efficiency. John emphasised the unique value proposition of OX.DH: \u201cWe don\u2019t just offer software; we provide a SaaS service that enables our clients to focus more on patient care rather than struggling with outdated technology.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHe further explained OX.DH\u2019s role within the broader IVF ecosystem, facilitating easy access to information for both clinicians and patients. Through case studies, John showcased how the technology streamlines processes by consolidating information into a single platform and automating workflows, thus reducing the reliance on cumbersome manual systems.\u00a0\nA significant focus was placed on the foundational research behind OX.DH\u2019s development. John shared insights into comprehensive studies of the fertility ecosystem, including interviews to understand the dynamics within and outside clinics. This research informed the core functionalities of OX.DH, aimed at improving patient experiences, clinical outcomes, and healthcare productivity through digital solutions. He also highlighted the active engagement from GPs, referral sources, pharmaceutical suppliers like Stork and Fertility2U, laboratories such as TDL and internal labs, and regulatory bodies, all of which play a crucial role in the ecosystem.\u00a0\nJohn praised Microsoft\u2019s cloud innovations, especially within the NHS\u2019s vast Microsoft environment in the UK. He clarified the use of the graph APIs and dataverse as critical components for storing and managing data. This allows for the configuration and customisation of clinical scheduling and patient information management, enhancing the utility of tools like Outlook for clinical purposes. John\u2019s discussion underscored OX.DH\u2019s integration with Microsoft\u2019s cloud services for a more efficient and secure data management system.\u00a0\nClinical operations\u00a0\nJohn elaborated on the operational capabilities of OX.ar within clinical settings, leveraging OX.DH\u2019s APIs with the broader ecosystem. He explained the patient\u2019s journey from initial engagement to comprehensive care management.\u00a0\nInitially, potential patients might explore a clinic\u2019s website for fertility support information. OX.ar allows them to register, enabling the provision of targeted digital marketing materials. Similar to creating an account on familiar platforms like banking or travel websites, interested individuals can easily register, inputting basic information.\u00a0\nUpon registration, an automated process commences to verify the patient\u2019s identity, followed by a review by clinic staff who may request further details. This step activates additional workflows, including the distribution of digital documents and access to a patient portal for medical history submission. This process triggers tailored healthcare queries based on the patient\u2019s input.\u00a0\nJohn highlighted specific functionalities, such as the digital distribution, signing, and storage of necessary HFEA forms in a patient-specific SharePoint library. The system automates reminders for patients to schedule initial consultations, which can be done in-person or via video. It also facilitates external communications for tests and prescriptions, ensuring a comprehensive view of each patient\u2019s journey.\u00a0\nCentral to OX.ar\u2019s utility is a robust invoice and finance module for generating invoices and processing payments seamlessly within the platform. Integration within the Microsoft ecosystem means that all communications, including emails and SMS, are directly linked to the patient or partner\u2019s record. This ensures a centralised record of interactions accessible to all relevant clinic staff.\u00a0\nOX.ar further enhances clinic operations by enabling the organisation and analysis of test results, document exchange with patients, and the assessment of various data points, thereby streamlining patient management and care delivery processes.\u00a0\nConcluding thoughts\u00a0\nTo wrap up, John walked the audience through OX.ar\u2019s operational benefits in clinics, highlighting the patient journey from initial inquiry to treatment completion.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe presentation illuminated the transformative power of OX.ar in the fertility clinic landscape, with detailed insights into the platform\u2019s development, capabilities, and impact offering a compelling vision for the future of fertility clinic management. John underscored the platform\u2019s capability to automate as much of that as possible, including the management of financial transactions and communications.\u00a0\nFor more information, John encouraged attendees to explore the OX.DH website.\u00a0\nWe\u2019d like to thank John for taking the time to share more information with us about the OX.ar platform.\u00a0\u00a0\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026NHSE shares update on metrics for urgent and emergency care\u2026Digital Health and Care Wales 2024-2027 primary care\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "NHS Dumfries and Galloway experiences \u201cfocused and ongoing\u201d cyber attack", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/20/nhs-dumfries-and-galloway-experiences-focused-and-ongoing-cyber-attack/", "content": "\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway has announced that a \u201cfocused and ongoing\u201d cyber attack has taken place on its IT systems, with the health board \u201cgenerally running as normal\u201d at present.\nThe board shares that work is ongoing to identify the consequences of the attack, and to assess \u201cthe concern that those responsible may have acquired a significant amount of data\u201d, including patient and staff information.\nChief exec Jeff Ace has stated that along with assessing risk, NHS Dumfries and Galloway is working with partner agencies to ensure the security of systems and to adapt to the disruption.\nHe said: \u201cIt must be noted that this is a live criminal investigation, and we are very limited in what we can say.

I called it PeopleDotCom because it\u2019s all about the people \u2013 that\u2019s the bit of digital transformation that interests me most. I\u2019m really fascinated by what gets in the way of successful digital transformation, and why the big hopes and aspirations for digital often fall flat or don\u2019t quite achieve what they\u2019re hoping to achieve. There are many different reasons for that, but one of the big reasons is that we don\u2019t design with people; we don\u2019t spend enough time understanding the problems they\u2019re trying to solve, and we don\u2019t engage people enough right from the get-go.\u201d\nSince the company started, it has worked mostly with the NHS, but also with national bodies, charities, and arms-length bodies, looking at design thinking, engagement and complexity.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to make any change in a complex system, it\u2019s really hard to do because there are so many moving parts,\u201d Victoria reflected.\nCo-creating change and transformation in the NHS\nOn making effective change in the NHS, Victoria noted that whilst co-design and coproduction are often talked about, it often seems that these elements of change are an afterthought or at \u201cthe bottom of the ladder\u201d in terms of priority.\n\u201cIf we have the resources and the time \u2013 which is a really tricky thing in the NHS \u2013 then we can do a really good job, but too often we rush to the solution and then get failure demand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou then have to go and sort it out when it doesn\u2019t work. So if you can create that time, space and capacity at the beginning, to really do your discovery and co-create with people, then you get much better results; but it\u2019s not always easy to make that case.\u201d\nVictoria talked to us about a course that PeopleDotCom is currently running for digital teams on design thinking, which began at the Northern Care Alliance with focus on developing a training programme for their digital team.\n\u201cOut of that, we developed our digital transformation by design course, because we realised that whilst digital teams often want to bring people like me in to help them with discovery or help them with engagement, actually they want to learn how to do it themselves,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a much more embedded, sustainable way of doing it. So we\u2019ve developed a whole range of different courses; our foundation course is a three-day course delivered over a period of weeks, where we introduce digital teams to everything from discovery and co-creation through to optimisation and generating evidence. Then we\u2019ve also got an online course for individuals, which is six modules over six weeks, and we\u2019ve had really good feedback from that. It\u2019s very participatory, there\u2019s lots of interaction and people seem to really enjoy it.\u201d\nWhilst digital teams are under a lot of pressure from the number of services requiring their support, Victoria acknowledged, there is a lot of work that can go into ensuring that something is embedded right from the beginning, which can help further down the line.\n\u201cWe can help them take a step back and think about how they organise themselves, and how they might apply some of these methodologies to help them take a more systematic approach to digital transformation projects,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this approach, you start with user research, understanding user needs, and then once you\u2019ve really understood the problems that need to be solved, you can work with key stakeholders and end users to co-design.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve implemented something, that\u2019s just the start \u2013 you then need to get those changes in behaviour embedded over time. So you do need to continue to work with teams to optimise, and you can take a user-centred design approach to that as well.\u201d\nWith design thinking, Victoria continued, it\u2019s key to take the time to really understand that problem that you are trying to solve, and avoid the tendency to \u201ctreat technology as a commodity like a product or service\u201d, rather than thinking about it in its context.\n\u201cThinking about it in this way helps you in developing your requirements, and it also helps you through your procurement process and your implementation,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though you have to spend more time on it at the beginning, that means you can go faster later on.\u201d\nTackling challenges within the NHS\nWe asked Victoria for her thoughts on the main barriers to design thinking within the NHS. She said: \u201cOne barrier is just time and capacity, because everything is under so much pressure at the moment. One way that we work around that is the fact that we don\u2019t take people out of services to come to us \u2013 we go and do the user research work in context, within services.\u00a0That means we can observe what people are doing and how people are working.\n\u201cThe other thing is that whilst user-centred design as an approach is well understood, it\u2019s not as socialised and used within local trusts.\u00a0 There are some exceptions \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing quite a bit of work with Somerset, for example, and they\u2019ve got an amazing user-centred design team that they are growing and developing.\u201d\nVictoria commented that her background was in quality improvement when she worked within the NHS, and noted the \u201cnice overlap\u201d between quality improvement and digital transformation, though she also acknowledged differences. \u201cThe digital element tends to focus more on ergonomics and usability, and QI more on the process side of things. I\u2019m always keen to work with QI teams; the best projects are where we collaborate with both the digital team and the QI team. There are actually quite a lot of change capabilities within trusts, and if you can bring them all together you can do some really interesting work; but I think user-centred design is often the missing bit of the jigsaw.\u201d\nVictoria added that there is a need to find a way of giving trusts who are doing really good work in this area a voice to share their experiences and what they\u2019ve been doing. She highlighted the need to create \u201creally strong case studies\u201d, encouraging the measuring of value, so that this can be shared with other people.\nLooking ahead\nOn hopes for the future with PeopleDotCom, Victoria shared that she would like to continue work on the development of the digital transformation by design training course, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve just loved delivering it, and we get such good feedback from it\u201d.\nShe added that the team has developed an \u201cessentials\u201d course for the wider staff group and hopes to start delivering that. \u201cWe\u2019ve also been developing a series of masterclasses in things like systems thinking, and we\u2019ve got a WhatsApp community and a six-weekly show and tell, so that people that have been on our courses can come and problem solve together. We\u2019re building a community, which we\u2019re really enjoying, and we want to be able to do more, and build on the foundation course to give people more tools and methods.\u201d\nYou can find more course information here.\nAs a final note, Victoria shared a statement that she has put together with Ayesha Rahim, clinical lead for digital mental health at NHS England, encouraging people to stand up to discrimination following the recently publicised comments by Frank Hester.

They are step-by-step guides on how a particular organisation went about achieving a set of digital benefits, and they have been peer-reviewed by a team that works with us within the blueprinting programme.\u201d\nPaul talked about how the blueprinting team try to take up initiatives around the different strategic drivers that apply to the digital landscape, and how current work is ongoing to \u201ctry and tie together so we can be more joined-up with all these initiatives\u201d.\nSaj shared a few of the blueprinting team\u2019s current objectives, including increasing their portfolio around good practice within the NHS and the EPR levelling-up agenda, creating more blueprints that will add value for frontline users, and working on bespoke blueprints in areas such bed management.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really keen to create a blueprint to raise the profile of good practice, and with the digital access e-hub for online consultations the trust have actually implemented something that has added value. By blueprinting it, we\u2019re trying to raise quality, safety and efficiency across the health and care system. It has the potential to reduce pressures, but also to optimise information that could be shared across an ICS.\u201d\nSaj then went on to highlight some of the examples of blueprinting work undertaken to date, including Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust\u2019s EMIS migration and merger project blueprint, and South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust\u2019s electronic observations blueprint. On statistics, she revealed that the Blueprinting Workspace currently has over 3,400 members, with just under 3,000 views of the Blueprinting Library in February of 2024, with a total of 211 blueprints and 215 \u2018blueprints on a page\u2019 published for people to browse.\n\u201cThe full blueprint tells the whole story of a digital solution, in terms of process, successes and challenges. You then have a one-page blueprinting summary which tells you about key insights and benefits achieved, and finally a technical annex, which offers a more detailed overview of implementing technical solutions and roll-out. At the moment, our library offers blueprints around clinical noting, bed management, remote monitoring and so on. Our libraries align with the business capabilities around the digital maturity assessment, and we\u2019re looking to enhance and develop more on areas such cybersecurity and EPR.\u201d\nDigital access e-hub North West London\nAaron Hamilton, senior project manager for the Healthcare Centre London (HCL) GP Federation, took over the conversation at this point, along with Nigel Gausden, senior programme manager and subject matter expert in primary care and urgent care for Seneca Advisory.\nAaron explained that the federation covers 32 practices in central London and shared a little of HCL\u2019s work, including operating several NHS contracts on behalf of their four PCNs and providing a range of support to practices and PCNs, running patient engagement and leading several transformation projects.\nNigel explained how the digital access e-hub project was funded, saying that North West London ICB wanted to help practices and primary care to work at scale and adopt new working practices around how patients want to access healthcare. On where the journey started, Nigel said, \u201cWe encouraged PCN clinical directors, through lots of engagement, to understand how they could work at-scale \u2013 what the benefits of this could be for their work-life balance and also for their practices.\u201d\nAaron shared that HCL wanted to work towards the new GMS contract requirement and IIF requirements that came in for practices on online consultations for patients. They already had eConsult, he added, which was commissioned as an online consultation tool across NW London, before receiving seed funding from the NWL digital team.\n\u201cWe took proposals to all of our practices around the at-scale delivery model, and we found that there was lots of anxiety about how they would manage online consultations. I think for some practices, it felt like we were opening another lane on the motorway that needed to be staffed, and they were so busy with the day-to-day work that there wasn\u2019t really time for them to look at how they could take on online consultations at a practice level. So it was welcomed that the federation would do this on their behalf.\u201d\nWhen it came to getting practices on board, Nigel explained that as a digital first team, they had worked to put together a simple process for expression of interest, to say which practices, PCNs and groups of PCNs would be willing to test the model. This also worked to outline possible benefits and gauge appetite for collective working, sharing roles and combining budgets.\n\u201cWe offered this out across NW London, which has a patient population of just over 2.6 million and over 350 practices, across 43 PCNs. One of the most expressive and forward-thinking ones was HCL, and we proceeded to award seed funding and work with them to develop their service,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen looking at deciding the operating model, we looked at the type of consultations that should be administered by the hub, how it would be financially sustainable post-seed funding, what ARRS roles were available at PCN level to support, and how we could support those who might be digitally excluded.\u201d\nNigel added: \u201cCrucially, we did a lot of internal marketing, so not only the GPs and the partners, but to the practice managers, reception staff, practice leads, and so on. They could then help us work on changing that direction, supporting the extended use of the NHS app, and linking that in with Patients Know Best.\u201d\nRealising the vision\nAaron shared some insight around the way that the hub\u2019s overall vision was decided upon, through discussions with practices and PCNs. An agreement was reached that the hub should be supporting the more transactional care, whilst the relational issues would be going back to practices.\nThe digital first team initially rolled out an online consultation product during COVID. Nigel said that following a lot of patient and practice feedback, a new procurement process was launched which led to the procurement of PATCHs, which had \u201cmore integrated hub working or working-at-scale functionality\u201d.\n\u201cWe needed to ensure that that was available to everybody, that the full healthcare record could be seen when triaging. This was one entry point for the patient, offering a seamless patient journey. Data sharing agreements were put in place, and we also aligned this with the Accurx messaging platform for clinicians, so there was easy consultation with patients going forward, whether that was video consultation or a telephony consultation. Then we had common coding for requests coming through, with requests being visible to member practices, so HCL could see the amount that was coming in across the board rather than just a snapshot.\u201d\nAaron talked about setting standard operating procedures for practices with inclusion and exclusion criteria, and how initially this was mainly care coordinators providing an administrative function. As time went on, however, they began \u201clayering up\u201d and including a clinical MDT within that.\n\u201cAt HCL, we have data processing capabilities across our BI team, so we made sure we got good quality data back to practices \u2013 that meant they could see what patients were coming through, what times, what days, what they were coming for, what proportion of online consultations were closed at hub level and so on. We had a clear governance process, we did regular audits with mechanisms for regularly reviewing those, and we had tools for communicating across the team, using WhatsApp and MS Teams initially.\u201d\nMoving forward: the hub in practice\nAround the development of the hub, Aaron highlighted the role of a senior clinical decision maker who oversaw decision making and processes to make sure they were safe, and the team\u2019s work on creating a pilot with a small cohort of practices \u201cto make sure we got it right\u201d. Alongside their clear governance structure, they conducted liability mapping around patient journeys to test who was responsible and at what point.\n\u201cIt was an in-hours service, so offered 8am-6:30pm Monday to Friday, with the team based at the HCL office. The core team was comprised of a GP clinical lead, six ARRS-funded care coordinators, and two ARRS-funded advanced nurse practitioners. Then we added in the extended team, which was the clinical pharmacists, first-contact physios, and then community pharmacist consultation service .\u201d\n\u201cThis work has given us a solid foundation to start to layer on top of. We are in the process of moving all of our practices onto one shared cloud telephony system, and linking that up so that the centralised hub can provide another layer of support to our practices via the team of already-dedicated care coordinators that have been working to process online consultations. We\u2019ve got solid redirection pathways in place to redirect patients out into the community and self-help services; we\u2019re in line with IIF targets; and we\u2019ve made efficiency savings working at-scale and taking a centralised approach.\u201d\nWhen it came to accelerating the hub\u2019s development, Aaron talked about some of the key features which had made an impact, including a new translate feature which enabled patient submissions in their native language, and a feature which allowed patients to dictate their symptoms which would then come through to the hub as an online consultation request.\n\u201cOne of the things we did was we held a competition for practice administrators, acknowledging the input that they had, and the valuable role that they played in getting patients to submit online consultations. About two thirds of our practices were hitting those KPI targets of six percent of practice lists being registered for online consultations, and achieving a rate of one online consultation per 1,000 registered patients per day.\u201d\nLooking at where the hub is today, Nigel highlighted its impact on tackling same-day demand and the 8am rush, and the benefits offered to bring hard-to-reach patients on board, taking advantage of the ability to deal with multiple requests through one contact, \u201cwhich helps practices with their targets and also leads into population healthcare which was one of the features of the PCN model\u201d.\n\u201cHCL have really grabbed this with both hands and taken this model forward. It\u2019s nowhere near the end of its journey; it\u2019s probably nearer the beginning; but it\u2019s already opened up opportunities to see what it can achieve in the future.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to thank our panellists for their time in sharing these insights with us.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/18/over-40-htn-now-online-webinars-planned-for-2024/", "content": "\nOur HTN Now series offers live webinars and discussion panels on a variety of topics in the health tech space, with tickets free to all NHS professionals \u2013 come along and hear from other health tech professionals as they share their approaches, considerations and best practice suggestions.\nTomorrow (19 March) we have three live sessions on the agenda, beginning with a panel discussion at 10am exploring the question: what will a CIO role look like in five to ten years?

This type of guidance helps trusts navigate through the challenges of securing their networks better.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThere has also been funding into cyber security at trust and ICS level \u2013 it\u2019s good to see those resources being spent, and awareness raised in this way. I am anticipating more funding to be released in the new financial year, starting in April.\u201d\n\n\nFrom the next financial year, Doron added, each ICS is to have a head of cyber security; this is a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d he said, \u201cas having these roles in place will support ICSs in working together and standardising on cyber security initiatives.\u201d\n\n\nStandardisation is a key benefit of working across the system when it comes to cyber security, Doron pointed out. \u201cIt enables peers to share ideas, to share best practice, and to really get the most out of the tools and means they deploy within the different trusts. Having a global view at ICS level of the security posture of each individual NHS trust gives a lot of value. We have recently engaged with one of the ICS\u2019s in the North to accomplish exactly that.\u201d He added that ICS working can also lead benefits around centrally procuring solutions.\n\n\nWhat about the challenges? \u201cIt can obviously be challenging bringing different trusts to act together,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhen you bring any organisations together, there can be friction. So, getting to the level of collaboration required can be challenging, but it depends on the region and on the individual ICS too. I am optimistic at the eventual outcome.\u201d\n\n\nGetting funding centrally from NHS England can also be a challenge, Doron noted; but he shared his view that NHSE is \u201clooking at cyber security and the standardisation required favourably and very much encouraging that collaboration, so I think the input from NHSE is positive.\u201d\n\n\nWe asked Doron whether he felt that there was anything that the NHS could learn from other healthcare systems across the world in terms of the approach to cyber security. He said: \u201cWe are seeing a lot of legislation and regulation happening in the US, specifically around medical device security, that NHS England could learn from. For example, there are regulations that will not allow certain medical devices to be connected into a hospital if they haven\u2019t been strictly scrutinised and confimed as being safe from cyber threats.\u201d\n\n\nFrameworks and guidance around cyber security are \u201cquite different in the US, in terms of the fact that the US healthcare system is primarily private,\u201d Doron noted, \u201cbut I think the challenges at a cyber level are actually very similar in both places. The key difference is the way that funding is spent \u2013 but I think that the UK could easily adopt some of the US\u2019s approach in this space. Increased focus on patient data security is also common to both the US and the UK. We are addressing these concerns with our new ePHI offering.\u201d\n\n\nHe added that the perceived importance of cyber security and the need to bring it to the top of the agenda is \u201cvery advanced in the US. The UK isn\u2019t that far behind, but there is still work to be done.\u201d\n\n\nDoron moved on to speak of his hopes for the NHS around cyber security over the next year or so, including an increase in spending on cyber security.\n\n\n\u201cI would like to see more guidance around the cyber security of medical devices, and just generally more money and resources going toward cyber security. Having cyber leads in each ICS is great, but we need to make sure that these positions actually get filled \u2013 it\u2019s quite a challenge, as there are obviously 42 roles to be filled there. But I\u2019d really like to see it happen.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, Doron touched upon his hopes for Cynerio for the next 12 months, indicating that he would like to see continued growth in the UK market.\n\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been successful so far in the UK because we have identified specific product features that are required for NHS trusts, and I would like to continue that through our partnerships with other players within the market. We\u2019re going to grow the team here in the UK; ultimately, we just want to continue to help NHS trusts protect against the next cyber attack.\u201d\n\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank Doron for his time in sharing this insight with us.\n\n\nCynerio recently launched, a new enhanced Healthcare Cybersecurity Platform, which seeks to address some of the key cyber security challenges that health and care organisations can face, such as limited resources, a dependence on outdated tech and constant evolution of cyber threats.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nRelatedInterview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026NHS Dumfries and Galloway experiences \"focused and ongoing\"\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Interview: \"It's about opening up opportunities to get to\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "London independent hospital signs contract for web-based EPR", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/18/london-independent-hospital-signs-contract-for-web-based-epr/", "content": "\nPrivate hospital, the New Victoria Hospital, London, has signed a contract with MEDITECH to provide its web-based electronic health record, Expanse.\nThe company noted the\u00a0EHR will be hosted on the Google Cloud Platform through MEDITECH UK, provided as a \u201csubscription-based solution\u201d.

Our partnership with MEDITECH will empower us to use digital tools and technology like AI to continue to grow our business in an increasingly challenging world.\u201d\nThe EPR will also add to the Hospital\u2019s patient engagement efforts with the introduction of a patient portal, such as electronic forms and questionnaires.\nDr Peter Wilson, medical director at the New Victoria Hospital, added:\u00a0\u201cClinicians are using electronic systems in their NHS hospitals as well as their own practises, and expect to be able to share data electronically. The implementation of Expanse will deliver a more complete patient record, enabling us to provide more comprehensive and informed care to our community.\u201d\nIn related news on EPR, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has announced Nervecentre as its electronic patient record supplier, to form a \u201cpivotal role in achieving the trust\u2019s digital vision\u201d. It follows recent news of the company being named the preferred EPR system provider by\u00a0University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS FT and Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS FT, as well being named the preferred EPR supplier at Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust, last month.\nElsewhere, University Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust has announced that Epic has been selected as the supplier for the trust\u2019s new EPR, subject to approval of the full business case. UHP notes that Epic already supplies the EPR for Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Trust and has recently been announced as the supplier for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, sharing hopes that these three acute trusts in Devon \u201chave an exciting opportunity to provide a truly joined up EPR solution\u201d to \u201csupport both operational efficiency and patient safety across the region\u201d.\nRelatedUniversal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026HTN Now: NW London's digital access e-hub for consultations\u2026Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\u2026Royal Orthopaedic Hospital strategy highlights plans for\u2026Central and North West London NHS awards contract for\u20262024/25 GP contract places focus on role of data from\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "SBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award \u00a3885,000 to nine innovations around young people\u2019s health", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/14/sbri-healthcare-and-the-health-innovation-network-award-885000-to-nine-innovations-around-young-peoples-health/", "content": "\nSBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network have awarded \u00a3885,000 to nine innovations with a focus on improving children and young people\u2019s health.\nProjects awarded funding include a device to assess wheeze and asthma in children using machine learning; a smart inhaler for asthma patients; a solution to help diagnose children with suspected epilepsy; a digital health passport for epilepsy; a POC breath test using AI to predict asthma exacerbations in children; wearable technology to improve diabetes management in children and young people; an augmented reality app for children and young people with epilepsy; a POC test for micronutrient deficiencies in children with obesity; and digital tools to help overcome emotional eating and lack of physical activity in children.\nApplications were open for single companies and organisations across the public, private and third sectors, including charities, SMEs, universities, and NHS providers, in the areas of asthma care, epilepsy care, obesity, oral health, and diabetes care.\nVarena Stocker, interim director of innovation, research, life sciences and strategy at NHS England, said: \u201cThe SBRI Healthcare awards help the NHS to develop new technologies and solutions to address some of the biggest healthcare challenges facing society.

Over the five years, she highlighted that NHS England hopes to transition a third of all interactions made via digital means through the NHS App and NHS England page.\n\nOn the reasons why people use the app at present, Liz said that around 58 percent of users in January utilised the app to view records, information and results. 15 percent came to access prescriptions and medicines.\nShe also commented the demographics of users, with pensioners said to be \u201cthe most active\u201d users of the NHS App; nearly two thirds of those registered who are aged over 66 have accessed the app within the past three months.\nThe priorities for the digital citizen and mobile-first services, Liz continued, are around a number of key topics: keeping people healthy through supported self-management along with screenings and vaccinations; supporting joined-up care through increased access to records; improving self-care through active signposting to therapeutics; and relieving pressure on the frontline via improved navigation to the right place at the right time. Other priorities are to increase the digital adoption of prescriptions through GPs; and to \u201cunlock the true potential\u201d of appointment booking including secondary care and elective care, with a focus on follow-ups.\nAdditionally, an enabler receiving priority focus is the need to provide a modern mobile experience to increase engagement and usage. On this, Liz commented that a \u201clot of work\u201d is underway currently to \u201cbuild out the native capabilities so that we can leverage some of the functionality available through iOS and Android\u201d.\nRachel joined the discussion to share some more detailed insights into app developments, explaining that the \u201cchallenge ahead\u201d is to bring together digital prevention services and explore how the NHS App can be used to underpin proactive care.\nShe placed specific emphasis on the app workstream focused on keeping people healthy, stating that this focus \u201csignals our tilt towards digital interventions that can help people to stay well\u201d. She described the NHS App as national infrastructure, but noted the need to support this national infrastructure \u201cin a sustainable way, with sustainable investment\u201d.\nIn terms of how the NHS App can go further, Rachel highlighted that it needs to help people better understand their health as well as risks to their health and how to take action, whether that means protection through vaccinations, providing a reminder that a health check up is required, or encouraging them to attend a screening. In this way, the future direction for the app places emphasis on early identification and diagnosis where possible, as well as helping people understand how they change their lifestyle to stay healthy.\nRachel said that the team is putting a lot of effort into improving the digital front door and to ensure that services are accessible. She mentioned that one aspect of this is the validation of proxy relationships that can be accessed via connected services, for people who may have caring needs or responsibilities.\nAnother focus is on tailoring user experiences, so that experience is personalised according to behaviour and characteristics. This will involve predicting where care may be needed and the most appropriate services to deliver it.\nThe \u201clatest medtech\u201d can also be introduced where appropriate, Rachel noted, to allow people to increasingly self-manage. She provided the example of someone taking a blood pressure reading through their smartphone, and the increased introduction of signposted digital therapeutics into the NHS App.\nThis will lead to \u201cincreasingly rich data\u201d on what people are doing and what their health outcomes are, to support NHSE decision-making and increase the evidence base on what is working.\n\nRelatedOver 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026Digital Health and Care Wales 2024-2027 primary care\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u2026Data linkage, app development and a rare disease prevalence\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier compliance, supporting supply chain resilience", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/14/htn-at-rewired-2024-managing-cyber-threats-supplier-compliance-supporting-supply-chain-resilience/", "content": "\nWe took a trip to Rewired this week to listen to insightful talks on various digital healthcare topics and chat to health tech professionals from the NHS and beyond \u2013 here, we\u2019ll share some of our main takeaways from the cyber security stage.\nFirst up, we listened to Professor Daniel Ray, chief technology officer at Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust and professor of health informatics at University College London, as he discussed how the trust handled an outage that took place in August 2022.\nDaniel explained how the trust covers three sites, and in August that year the organisation that hosted their mental health system underwent a cyber attack and went down. With it becoming apparent that the outage would last for some time, Daniel highlighted the importance of sitting down with clinical services to identify the core functionality required to run those services as needed, in order to still deliver care for patients.\nDocumenting decisions throughout the process was key, he added, so that each decision could be explained at the required levels.\nHe shared how the trust has since implemented mandatory training that is updated on an annual basis. Staff members are given three reminders to complete the training, and if they don\u2019t complete it within the necessary timeframe, their account is locked out of the system. Daniel\u2019s team have also delivered educational materials on up-to-date cyber threats for staff, as part of efforts to raise awareness and engagement.\nAdditionally, since the outage, Daniel described how the trust has started to hold unannounced \u2018hack days\u2019, whereby they simulate what would happen if systems went down. Initially, he said, there was a sense of alarm; but as awareness has progressed, more recent hack days have been focused on delivering a slick recovery process instead with a stronger sense of confidence from staff.\nOn the supplier side, Daniel encouraged trusts to get third party assurance that structures maintain up-to-date security standards; in Birmingham, he said, they have developed an \u201cintensive\u201d security questionnaire which suppliers must complete in order to work with the trust, and they are required to supply evidence on how they meet those standards.\nAs a final comment, Daniel emphasised that it is \u201cinvaluable\u201d to have 24 hour eyes on the system.\nWe also listened to Alun Kime, cyber security contracts manager at Digital Health and Care Wales, and Ed Trimbee, regional cyber crime unit manager at West Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit, as they discussed how organisations can assure the resiliency of their supply chain.\nAlun reiterated Daniel\u2019s point about needing to gain assurance from suppliers; he encouraged organisations to review obligations with their suppliers and ask them to perform tests to provide that assurance.\nAcknowledging that it is often very complex to untangle existing contracts and commitments with organisations often having relationships to maintain with a number of different suppliers, Alun stated that \u201cthe future is the chance to put things right\u201d. He encouraged all procurement needs to undergo thorough assessment and emphasised the importance of getting the contract right. It should include the need to define security requirements from the very start, he said, as well as other elements such as the right to audit and an exit strategy.\nSummarising his key messages, Alun accepted that it isn\u2019t an easy situation for any organisation; it is a long-term change process that needs to be adaptive. He recommended that organisations take a proactive approach, to develop their relationship with procurement and commercial services, and to \u201cdo due diligence throughout the life cycle\u201d. Other tips included prioritising systems based on business impact and defining security roles and responsibilities.\nEd picked up on these points, adding that a key message is to start now rather than waiting until later. He emphasised that organisations need to develop their understanding of what needs to be protected and why; to know their suppliers and what their security looks like in enough detail; and as such to develop their understanding of the risk coming from their supply chain.\nIn terms of where to look for guidance, Ed pointed to three key resources \u2013 the data security and protection toolkit, the National Cyber Security Centre\u2019s cyber assessment framework, and also their supply chain security guidance.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026NHS Dumfries and Galloway experiences \"focused and ongoing\"\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024Interview: Doron Dreyer, Cynerio, on the opportunities and\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what does the future hold for the NHS\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual wards?", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/14/htn-at-rewired-2024-what-have-we-learned-from-virtual-wards/", "content": "\nAt Rewired 2024, we sat in on a session exploring what we have learned from virtual wards so far as well as potential next steps, featuring Dr Amanda Begley (executive director of digital transformation for the Health Innovation Network); Tara Donnelly (founder of Digital Care and previous chief digital officer for NHS England); and Umesh Gadhvi (chief digital and information officer for North East London Foundation Trust).\nFirstly, Amanda shared some insights from focus group work undertaken by the Health Innovation Network to gather evidence for a review into virtual wards. Patients responded well to being able to stay in their home environment, around their loved ones, with emerging evidence suggesting \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d that patients are very positive about virtual wards \u201cwhether they are tech or non-tech enabled\u201d.\nAmanda noted that staff were also generally \u201cvery positive\u201d around virtual wards, with a lack of perceived problems around recruiting people onto virtual ward teams.\nHowever, she said, there is still plenty to be learned, particularly around carers; she highlighted a need for carers to be better equipped to provide time and technical advice for people receiving care in their home environment through a virtual ward. She acknowledged that there is also work to be done around health inequalities and improving digital literacy; and in considering whether people have a suitable environment at home to receive care.\nPatients also highlighted potential risks around isolation and equitable access, and what happens if virtual ward patients struggle with elements such as heating or electricity.\nAmanda said that the system is seeing return on investment through virtual wards; their research suggests that on average for every one pound invested, there is a return of \u00a32.80. This is based on small numbers, she acknowledged, but the trend is \u201cmoving in a positive direction\u201d.\nIn terms of what the future holds, Amanda commented on the need to integrate virtual wards in terms of a step-model approach, with an increased focus on urgent community response and rapid response services. In terms of a step-up approach, she said, there is a need to engage with proactive care teams and long-term condition teams. She called this \u201can area where we can really improve quality, safety and efficiency of our virtual wards\u201d.\nThere is a lot that can be done in order to enhance virtual wards, Amanda continued; she made points around the need to build confidence and awareness in virtual wards so that staff feel comfortable in referring to them, suggesting that more needs to be done around sharing patient stories and increasing knowledge of eligibility. Also on the workforce, Amanda highlighted that there has been work ongoing in London in particular around building \u201cin-reach\u201d and navigator roles to support virtual ward referrals.\nFurther advice included more consideration into the level of acuity that is suitable for virtual wards and the clinical leadership required as a result; and more learnings around technology and the \u201cart of the possible\u201d, with Amanda raising the need for further insight into point-of-care testing, diagnostics, the possibilities around AI its uses in identification, and more. She added that there must be a focus on interoperability too, \u201cto make it as seamless as possible for staff whilst ensuring that they capture the right data into health records\u201d.\nTara picked up on the conversation to highlight some of the work around virtual wards from the past year as well as her thoughts for the future. She commented that older people \u201care the most keen to use tech to stay out of hospital\u201d according to a survey of over 7,000 people last year, undertaken by The Health Foundation; this survey indicated that 78 percent of all ages \u201cwould be happy\u201d to use remote monitoring tech at home rather than go into hospital, and for people aged 65 and over this figure rose to 85 percent.\nMoving on to look at the national statistics around virtual wards from NHS England, Tara pointed out that there has been \u201ca bit of a shift\u201d with virtual ward figures moving from \u201cprimarily early discharge\u201d to a higher proportion being listed as \u201cadmission avoidance\u201d.\nPicking up on Amanda\u2019s point, Tara highlighted that there is \u201cloads more to do\u201d around tech enablement. 59 percent of virtual wards are declared to be tech-enabled; but the statistics from December indicate that only 29 percent of patients on virtual wards received tech-enabled care.\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to do in making sure that we are genuinely offering a new model of care that is supported by technology,\u201d Tara said, \u201cbecause that is where the real gains happen.\u201d\nShe added that from her experience in visiting virtual wards across the country, patient and carer reluctance is \u201cnever\u201d the main barrier to this; rather, it is \u201cmuch more to do with reassuring clinicians that these pathways are safe\u201d.\nIn terms of the future, Tara said that she believes the UK is largely ahead when it comes to virtual wards; but the European continent tends to be ahead when it comes to remote monitoring for long-term conditions. She noted that a high percentage of hospital admittances tend to come from loss of control over long-term conditions; therefore getting on top of this and reaching those people through virtual wards represents a step towards keeping these people out of hospital.\nUmesh then described the process for virtual ward scoping at North East London Foundation Trust, sharing that the programme sought to allow eligible patients to be accepted into an acute respiratory infection virtual ward for treatment. He highlighted a number of the deliverables involved, including undertaking process mapping to establish the end-to-end requirements, ensuring that digital technology assessment criteria was completed, configuring and testing solutions, and obtaining sign off from all stakeholders involved, including patient representatives.\nA key recommendation from Umesh was to avoid \u201cjust going out and buying tech\u201d without due consideration; he pointed out that there can be a lot of pressure and it can be easy to panic and make a purchase quickly, but then you will be tied in and your clinicians may not be happy if they have not participated in the selection of the technology.\nThe \u201cbiggest and number one\u201d tip from Umesh revolved around process mapping. \u201cDo not deliver anything without a process map,\u201d he said, encouraging organisations to ensure that they communicate with clinicians and listen to them about their needs. Engagement and listening is \u201cso key\u201d, he emphasised, because you need to create partnerships within your team and across teams in order for virtual wards to work.\nHe also highlighted the need to \u201cbe frank\u201d with suppliers such as EPR vendors and tell them when there are problems and challenges that are making your projects difficult, because it is not just a case of accepting problems as the norm. \u201cYou have power \u2013 you have a contract with them,\u201d he urged. \u201cTell them the truth about what is good and what is bad, and they will listen.\u201d\nRelatedOver 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024HTN at Rewired 2024: what does the future hold for the NHS\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier\u2026Digital Health and Care Wales 2024-2027 primary care\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u2026Data linkage, app development and a rare disease prevalence\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations to support equity in medical devices", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/14/department-of-health-and-social-care-shares-recommendations-to-support-equity-in-medical-devices/", "content": "\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has published the final report on an independent review into equity in medical devices, making 18 recommendations designed to address \u201cunfair biases\u201d identified through the course of the review.\nThe recommendations centre a number of key topics including AI-assisted medical devices, pulse oximeters and optical medical devices.\nEight of the 18 recommendations focus on AI-assisted devices, with recommendations including the need for developers and stakeholders to engage with diverse groups for co-design purposes; encouragement for government to commission an \u201conline and offline academy\u201d to increase understanding among all stakeholders of equity in AI-assisted medical devices; and a suggestion that UK regulatory bodies should be provided with long-term resources \u201cto develop agile and evolving guidance\u201d to assist innovators, businesses and data scientists in building processes to reduce unfair biases.\nAdditionally, the report states that research commissioners should prioritise diversity and inclusion, with the pursuit of equity as a \u201ckey driver of investment decisions and project prioritisation\u201d.

It notes that the MHRA should strengthen guidance on the accuracy and performance of these devices, including guidance on interpreting readings from patients with different skin tones; and co-design is raised again, with a recommendation that innovators, researchers and manufacturers collaborate with the public to design \u201cbetter, smarter oximeters using innovative technologies to produce devices that are not biased by skin tone\u201d. It is suggested that this could include development of enhanced algorithms to address measurement bias, and the exploration of \u201cmulti-wavelength systems which measure and correct for skin pigmentation\u201d.\nRegarding equity of optical medical devices, the report highlights a need for professional practice bodies in the UK to carry out an equity audit of optical devices in common use within the NHS; and encourages \u201crenewed efforts\u201d in increasing skin tone diversity in medical imaging databanks used in developing and testing devices, as well as improving the tools for measuring skin tone that are incorporated into optical devices.\nThe report states that these improvements \u201cnow need to be implemented as a matter of priority with full government support\u201d.\nThe 18 recommendations can be found in full here, along with insight into topics deemed out of scope for this review but \u201cnevertheless [raising] important equity issues for the future\u201d, including considerations around equity for wearable devices and access to devices.\nLast week, HTN covered the government\u2019s budget for long-term growth, including funding for digital transformation in the NHS.\nIn February, we highlighted DHSCs announcement that \u00a310 million would be made available in funding and used in part to support eight selected health tech companies in bringing innovative solutions to market.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Norfolk and Waveney ICB among eight organisations joining InSites innovation programme", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/14/norfolk-and-waveney-icb-among-eight-organisations-joining-insites-innovation-programme/", "content": "\nNHS Norfolk and Waveney ICB has announced its inclusion in the second year of the Clinical Entrepreneur Programme Innovation Sites (InSites) programme, designed to bring together NHS provider organisations to test innovative ways of patient care and evaluate them in real-world settings.\nThrough the programme, the ICB seeks to explore the development of a system-wide innovation culture, innovation needs mapping and evaluation of innovations addressing population health needs.\nOn a wider scale, organisations taking part in the second year of InSites will aim to collaborate around key NHS needs such as reduction of waiting times for patients, support for the workforce, and creation of more capacity in the system.\nFrom Norfolk and Waveney, associate director for research Dr Clara Yates and head of innovation Dr Tim Clarke shared hopes that the ICB\u2019s inclusion as an InSite \u201cwill allow us to share and learn from other sites across the country as well as accelerate our work with system partners to optimise the benefits that implementing innovation can bring\u201d.\nOther organisations taking\u00a0part in the second year of InSites are Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital;\u00a0Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust; Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust; Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; and North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust.

With its 40 assertions, the DSPT thoroughly examines an organisation\u2019s data security practices and its ability to handle sensitive health data.\nWhile meeting the DSPT requirements is obligatory for NHS suppliers, it also presents a strategic opportunity for organisations to elevate their data security practices and establish themselves as reliable partners within the healthcare ecosystem. However, implementing the DSPT can pose significant challenges, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs)which often lack the adequate resources, internal expertise, and experience in implementing the framework.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore common DSPT implementation challenges and provide practical strategies and tips to navigate them effectively.\u00a0\nUnderstanding the DSPT\nThe foundation of the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) lies in the National Data Guardian\u2019s 10 data security standards, which emerged in 2016 following a comprehensive review of data security, consent, and opt-outs within the health and social care system. Aligned with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018, and the NHS Constitution, these standards form the bedrock of data security practices within the UK healthcare sector. Additionally, the DSPT requires organisations to comply with the Cyber Essentials scheme. This government-backed certification indicates that an organisation has implemented the basic measures necessary to defend itself against the most common cyber attacks.\nThe DSPT serves a dual purpose: firstly, to assist organisations in enhancing their data security practices, and secondly, to assure both the public and regulators that both the NHS and its suppliers are appropriately safeguarding health and personal data. It is also a requirement for organisations seeking access to essential NHS interoperability systems and services, such as the NHS Spine, the NHS e-Referral Service, and the NHS App.\nThe DSPT isn\u2019t a one-time task; it\u2019s an ongoing process that serves as both a strength and a challenge. Annually refreshed to mirror shifts in legislation, guidance, and best practices, the current version, version 6, rolled out in August 2023 and remains effective until June 2024. Version 6 introduces several new requirements and changes, including the requirement to complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for all processing activities involving personal data and the need to provide evidence of staff training in data security and protection.\nCommon Challenges in Implementing the Data Security & Protection Toolkit:\nImplementing the DSPT can pose a daunting challenge for many organisations, notably smaller health and social care organisations, newcomers to the healthcare sector, and digital health innovators grappling with the regulatory requirements necessary to integrate their solutions into the NHS. Limited resources and expertise in data security and protection further compound this challenge. Some common DSPT implementation hurdles include:\nResource constraints: Completing the DSPT can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring organisations to assess their current data security and protection practices, identify gaps and risks, implement improvements, and provide evidence of compliance. Organisations may need to allocate sufficient staff, budget, and technology to support the implementation of the DSPT, which can be challenging for SMEs and commercial innovators who will most certainly have competing priorities and limited capacity.\u00a0\nAdditionally, as requirements are updated annually, organisations must continuously monitor changes in security and data protection to maintain compliance and adapt to any new demands introduced by the updated toolkit.\nComplexity of requirements: The DSPT covers a wide range of data security and protection topics, such as governance, policies, procedures, contracts, consent, data sharing, data quality, data retention, data disposal, data breaches, cyber security, encryption, access control, audit, and incident management. The DSPT also has different levels of compliance, such as mandatory, standards met, standards exceeded, and not applicable, depending on the type and size of the organisation and the nature and scope of the data processing activities. Understanding and applying the DSPT requirements can be complex and confusing for organisations with insufficient knowledge and experience in data security and protection.\nImplementing GDPR-compliant processes: The DSPT is not a substitute for complying with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 but a means of demonstrating this compliance. While an extensive framework, the DSPT doesn\u2019t provide a comprehensive list of all data security and protection obligations required for GDPR compliance, a legal requirement for all UK organisations. Instead, it sets forth a minimum set of standards and expectations. Organisations, especially those handling health data, will still need to implement GDPR-compliant processes and practices, such as conducting DPIAs, obtaining valid consent, providing transparent information, respecting data subject rights, implementing data minimisation and privacy by design.\nGaining Cyber Essentials Certification: The DSPT requires organisations to achieve the Cyber Essentials certification, a government-backed scheme verifying that an organisation has taken basic steps to protect itself from common cyber attacks. The Cyber Essentials certification covers five technical controls: secure configuration, boundary firewalls, access control, malware protection, and patch management. Organisations can attain Cyber Essentials Certification through either a self-assessment questionnaire or a verified assessment by an accredited body.\u00a0\nTraining, expense and awareness:\u00a0 The DSPT now requires organisations to provide regular and relevant training to all staff members with access to or handling personal data. One of the key aims of the recent DSPT update is to foster a robust cybersecurity culture. This update requires organisations to raise awareness among staff, patients, and partners about the importance of data security and protection through regular training, knowledge sharing, and events. However, meeting this requirement can be challenging, especially as cybersecurity training tends to be costly, and maintaining a culture of cybersecurity often takes a backseat amid the myriad other tasks that businesses must address.\nStrategies for Overcoming DSPT Challenges\nConduct a Comprehensive Gap Analysis: One of the initial steps organisations should take when beginning their DSPT compliance journey is to download the DSPT guidance and conduct a thorough gap analysis of how their existing organisational security and data protection practices measure up against the standards outlined in the DSPT framework. Since most DSPT assertions will require the submission of evidence to demonstrate compliance, organisations must carefully document their existing policies, processes, evidence of training, and technical security controls ready for submission.\nPlan and prioritise: Once gaps in compliance have been identified, organisations should create a focused action plan, including which security controls will be implemented, the assertions to which these controls will link, and what evidence must be collected to demonstrate adherence along clear deadlines.\u00a0\nIdeally, organisations should prioritise these implementation actions based on their associated risks; for example, organisations should remove any unauthorised or unnecessary access from systems that hold sensitive data before moving on to evidence items such as \u201cYour organisation understands the health and care services it provides\u201d. If an organisation processes health data, it must ensure that any third parties or suppliers involved in handling this data also comply with the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. This process ensures that all entities processing health data adhere to the standards required to safeguard and protect sensitive information.\nSeek guidance and support: The DSPT can be a complex and confusing tool, especially for organisations new to the health and social care sector or with limited knowledge and experience in data security and protection. Therefore, organisations should seek guidance and support from various sources, such as the DSPT website, DSPT webinars and workshops, the NHS Digital Data Security Centre, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and other relevant organisations and experts. These sources can provide valuable information, advice, and assistance to help organisations understand and apply the DSPT requirements, identify and address gaps and risks, and implement improvements and best practices.\nAchieve GDPR Compliance: While the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) sets standards for data security and protection, it\u2019s essential to understand that it doesn\u2019t replace GDPR compliance. Organisations aiming to meet the DSPT standard must provide evidence of compliance with all seven GDPR principles, including transparency, integrity, confidentiality, data minimisation, and accuracy. Rather than solely focusing on meeting GDPR-related assertions within the DSPT, organisations should strive for full compliance with the GDPR, a legal obligation for all UK entities, particularly those handling sensitive health data subject to additional processing requirements. Ensuring GDPR compliance simplifies meeting the DSPT and streamlines the creation of Data Protection Impact Assessments, crucial documents required by the DSPT and other healthcare frameworks like the Digital Technology Assessment Criteria.\nInitiate staff training early: Version 6 of the NHS DSPT, valid until the 30th of June 2024, now requires organisations to ensure all staff members receive appropriate and regular cyber security and data protection training, aiming to foster a robust culture of cyber security and data protection. To meet this assertion, organisations must provide evidence of this training and a completed training needs analysis outlining how the organisation has determined the specific training needs of each individual. Organisations should start working on this requirement as soon as possible, considering that organisations new to DSPT often encounter challenges in meeting this requirement due to the effort involved in sourcing suitable training, associated costs, and ensuring staff compliance with the training.\nContinuous Improvement: Maintaining compliance with the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) is an ongoing journey, not a one-time task. The DSPT undergoes annual updates to reflect changes in cyber security and data protection legislation, requiring organisations to continuously evaluate their practices to stay ahead of these changes.\u00a0\nAdditionally, impending legislative changes, like the new Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, will likely introduce new assertions to the DSPT, prompting organisations to update their data protection practices to ensure alignment with legislative requirements.\nTo keep up with these evolving requirements, organisations should implement a regular monitoring and auditing schedule, conduct regular assessments to identify any compliance gaps and take prompt action to resolve them. Compliance with the DSPT is not just about ticking a box; it\u2019s about ensuring organisations handling NHS and health data have the appropriate controls to keep this information safe and secure.\nFurthermore, the NHS plans to transition cyber elements from the DSPT to the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF). Developed by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the CAF is a mechanism for assuring the security practices of organisations which form part of the UK\u2019s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), including NHS suppliers. While not expected to come into force until 2025, at the earliest, organisations are advised to start preparing for this transition by aligning their data security and protection policies and practices with the five pillars of the CAF:\n\nFocus on the greatest risks and harms.\nDefend as one.\nPeople and Culture\nBuild security for the future\nExemplary response and recovery\n\nIn conclusion, implementing the NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) presents both challenges and opportunities for healthcare organisations. While ensuring compliance with the DSPT standards can be daunting, especially for organisations implementing the toolkit for the first time, it is an essential framework for safeguarding sensitive health data and maintaining trust with patients and regulators. As the healthcare sector increasingly becomes a target for cyber threats, organisations aspiring to become NHS suppliers should view DSPT compliance not only as a regulatory requirement but as a fundamental part of providing quality healthcare services. By prioritising data security and protection, organisations can uphold patient trust, mitigate risks, and contribute to a safer and more resilient healthcare environment.\nAbout Naq\nHundreds of NHS suppliers and organisations are using Naq to streamline their compliance with the frameworks they need to operate, including the Data Security and Protection Toolkit, GDPR, Cyber Essentials, NHS DTAC, and more.

It was an organisation that focused on lean methodology and how we could be efficient and productive by using technology to enable patient care, so that\u2019s where my passion came from. I was also one of the first digital Florence Nightingale scholars back in 2020, during the pandemic, and that opened doors to doing regional work. After that, I became the North West regional CNIO as well.\u201d\nSarah also talked about her passion for education, telling us how she was previously an educator and remains dual-registered as an adult registered nurse as well as a practice educator lecturer.\n\u201cA lot of digital innovation is around education and teaching, so I feel like the four hats of clinical leadership, education, and digital fit really nicely with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in a job that makes me get up in the morning, so that\u2019s really positive.\u201d\nLaunching a new clinical digital strategy\nOn developing the trust\u2019s new clinical digital strategy, Sarah explained that she spent her first three months at the trust conducting \u201cdiscovery work\u201d across the organisation, interviewing stakeholders from \u201cshop floor to board\u201d.\n\u201cDuring those discussions I really started to profile what the organisation wanted, and mapping a parallel process of where the organisation was, and where it needed to be. I reached out to a nurse in the North West for her help with visualising what the stakeholders had been telling me; because how do you create a message to an organisation with the playback of all of those interviews, without it being a lengthy document? She used artistry to present that picture, and then that was shared with a number of other organisations across the UK as an idea for how to send these kinds of big messages.\u201d\nSarah also shared that at the beginning of the process, the team had a relatively limited understanding of the actual digital maturity level across the organisation, and hadn\u2019t been utilising the What Good Looks Like framework.\n\u201cI needed to quickly utilise that framework to get to the grassroots of the feedback that I\u2019d had from the discovery work,\u201d she said, \u201cso as a consequence of that I realised that I didn\u2019t have the right infrastructure within the clinical digital team. We created some new deputy posts \u2013 a deputy midwife, deputy AHP and a deputy CNIO, and we already had an associate CCIO. I split the portfolios, because the organisation is so big \u2013 we\u2019ve got 25 clinical service units (CSUs) that we needed to work with to understand their digital maturity. This enabled us to work collaboratively and in partnership with CSUs for them to own their digital agenda.\u201d\nAs a small team, Sarah highlighted the importance of thinking from a \u201cspread and scale\u201d perspective, stating that by collecting information and completing a benchmarking process, the team could start to build-up a picture of what the strategy needed to look like.\n\u201cWe set up a task and finish group to do that, got everybody in the clinical digital team involved, and then they liaised with their CSUs to come up with their own key priorities,\u201d she shared. \u201cThat\u2019s how the story was built. Jess, the digital nurse who helped create visuals for the strategy feedback, came to work for us and helped us create all the illustrations and artistry that came from the original vision.\u201d\nOn this note, Sarah commented that helping people to understand the digital agenda is \u201ca very visual piece of work\u201d. She described how sometimes people would demonstrate that they knew the EPR was important but they didn\u2019t understand why, or they didn\u2019t understand the data sitting behind it and the importance of using that data to make decisions to improve outcomes. When software such as Microsoft Teams was implemented during the pandemic, \u201cpeople had to just run with it\u201d, she pointed out; meaning that there is lots of functionality within Teams that people \u201cdon\u2019t utilise, or don\u2019t know how it can help them in their day-to-day life, working clinically and operationally\u201d. Sarah\u2019s team is planning a skills sharing event in March this year to introduce some of those skills that can help people in their roles.\nComing back to the strategy development, Sarah said: \u201cUsing the What Good Looks Like framework has been phenomenal, because it\u2019s helped us with that benchmarking process; to understand the challenges at CSU level and then create the strategy based on what the key stakeholders initially told me back in September 2022.\n\u201cEngagement has also increased; we\u2019ve developed a digital advocate programme and we\u2019re now seeing the momentum of people understanding that digital is important and digital is your agenda. It belongs to all of us, just like infection control and safeguarding.\u201d Before this work, Sarah said, the digital team \u201cdidn\u2019t really have a voice in such a big organisation. People knew there was a digital service, but didn\u2019t necessarily know there was a clinical team that sat within it. I think what the clinical digital team has been able to do over the last 12 months is represent those professions and have that clinical expertise with a digital heart. It comes back to effective education and communication. Our marketing and communications manager Jane Shepherd deserves a big shout out because she\u2019s been critical to our comms efforts.\u201d\nPriorities in Leeds\nSarah talked to us about some of the main priorities within the clinical digital strategy, such as the paperless agenda. This led to the launch of a \u201cpaper picnic\u201d over the summer, documenting every single piece of paper being used to support in-patients in practice, with Sarah\u2019s team approximating that around 1,800 pieces of paper were in circulation.\n\u201cWe had about 195 forms within PPM+, our electronic health record, so we started to do a deeper dive and actually map what was in there, and how that married with the paper exercise,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe quickly picked up that we were missing opportunities \u2013 areas where things were in PPM+ but people were reverting back to paper. We did a massive piece of work around optimisation where we gave people direction in these areas. Because our EHR is developed and managed in house, we\u2019ve never had a go-live; it\u2019s been an evolving process. There was a tendency for people to think that it was an option and that they could revert back to paper. Getting exec buy-in was important for that, so it wasn\u2019t just something the digital team was saying.\u201d\nThrough this work, Sarah and her team identified all the aspects on PPM+ where paper could be removed to become more digitalised. \u201cIt\u2019s also helped us do a bit of a scoping on what core things are still missing within our EHR, and what we need to put in to help with the patient pathway, help with data, and improve our patient outcomes,\u201d she shared.\nThis process has been really important in encouraging engagement with the development of the clinical digital strategy, according to Sarah, empowering people to get on board.\n\u201cIt empowered the clinical shop floor to recognise the importance of data, and to realise that doing intentional manual rounding and scanning is not helpful, because we can\u2019t use the information and insights. It\u2019s a wasted process. The form is already there on PPM+ \u2013 we can triangulate rounding with pressure sores, falls and so on, and really start to improve patient outcomes.\n\u201cIn our VOD programme (visualisation, optimisation and digitalisation), we solely looked at nursing, midwifery and AHP, but now there\u2019s discussions around the wider professions as well, because this isn\u2019t just about nursing,\u201d Sarah continued. \u201cThat will be one of our major priorities, but for that to happen, we need to align digital advocates, people who have seen the journey we are on and the vision that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019re also developing a catalogue of learning material such as videos and webinars to help people on the shop floor, as that was one of the playbacks from the discovery work that I did; people didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\nSarah described how part of this work involves linking the digital advocates to that learning catalogue, \u201cbecause they\u2019re powerful in disseminating that for their CSU. We had a face-to-face digital advocate session last month \u2013 their passion was really powerful as they shared best practice with their team. Then we\u2019ve got the digital forum running parallel to that, so if you\u2019ve got an interest in digital you can access the forum, understand what we are doing and find out how you can contribute. We put lots of information on there,\u00a0we advertise training, and we offer access to conferences and things that might be of interest. It\u2019s about opening up opportunities using our comms strategy to get to the grassroots and bring people on that journey with us. It\u2019s building momentum, which takes time when you\u2019ve got a 24,000-strong workforce that is already pressured.\u201d\nCreating a benchmarking tool\nSarah explained that she started a North West regional CNIO network during the pandemic.\u00a0\u201cI was reaching out to the chief nurses and letting them know I was setting this group up, so if they had someone in that role we could share knowledge and expertise. We realised we needed something we could use as a benchmarking tool, so one of the CNIOs went away and created this lovely Excel sheet. Then five of us went back to our organisations to complete the benchmarking process and came back to share our best practice.\u201d\nAfter setting this up within the CNIO network, Sarah started to put out feelers, to see whether any companies would be interested in working with them to digitise the process. Based on the original Excel sheet, Genome developed a data repository, and when Sarah left that role to join Leeds, she asked her CIO at the time whether she could use the tool for her new trust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an evolving, agile process, but it\u2019s been pioneering in that we\u2019ve digitalised in six months,\u201d she stated. \u201cIt\u2019s some challenge, going from an Excel sheet to digital to actually implementing it and getting results.\u00a0We\u2019ve got more data now and we\u2019ve done the benchmarking process. We want to work with Genome more to figure out what the next steps are, how we can get to that next level.\u201d\nReferring to recent debates on the effectiveness of the What Good Looks Like framework, Sarah highlights Leeds as \u201ca glowing example\u201d of its potential impact, saying:\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process now of making it part of our ward metrics. We\u2019ve done digital health checks off the back of that, because we recognised that people didn\u2019t necessarily understand what was required from a digital point of view. This was the first time I\u2019ve had something tangible as a CNIO, that I could point to and say: \u2018This is the standard NHS England has set, this is what we need to meet.\u2019\u00a0We\u2019ve started to see some of that transition over the last six months. I think the visualisation aspect of it with the red, amber and green is powerful, because when you see that transition then you get better engagement, and you can see that benefits realisation piece.\u201d\nThe future of digital\u00a0\nTaking a more general view of Leeds as a trust, we asked Sarah what she thought that the future of digital looked like.\nShe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot going on in Leeds. We\u2019ve got the theatre robotics, and we\u2019re doing lots of work around virtual wards and virtual consultations. That\u2019s why the What Good Looks Like framework is really important, because everybody has their own digital transformation agenda. It\u2019s about working in partnership, using our expertise, and supporting that. We\u2019ve got the new hospitals build, as well, with an ambition to open in 2030, so again there\u2019s a lot of transitional work that needs to happen.\u201d\nSarah talked about recognising the need to get nurses and other clinicians to start thinking differently when introducing all this new technology, to adapt to changes in workflows, and to develop the ways they collect and use data across the organisation. She also noted the potential for a digital control room to be implemented to help handle the size and scale of the trust once more digital technologies are introduced.\nOn hopes and aims for the future, she said:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start looking at the transition across our roles, whether we can get patients onto a virtual pathway, and we will be continuing to work on projects like our personal health record so that patients are more empowered with access to their information. We\u2019ve got to shift to doing more health promotion and prevention, rather than managing the illness and disease process. I think the new curriculum is trying to do more of that, because we\u2019ve got the technology now around that preventative model, so that\u2019s one of the big tickets for the future. We\u2019re starting to understand what that looks like, and by doing these proof of concepts on a small scale, it increases the appetite and understanding for these bigger changes.\u201d\nReflecting that during the pandemic some of the \u201cred tape\u201d was cut in terms of digital, Sarah emphasised the need to ensure that this forwards momentum continues.\n\u201cWe need to push back and look at how we can work differently in the acute sector, because we are going to have to start pulling money out of the acute sector to invest in community and primary care,\u201d she stated. \u201cYou can see it now with the pharmacy model; who would have thought you could go into a pharmacy and get a consultation pre-pandemic? There\u2019s lots of great stuff happening. The NHS is a really exciting place to work, even with the pressure and the stress. It\u2019s a really rewarding job, and I would never leave it.\u201d\nIf you could tackle one challenge, what would it be?\nWe asked Sarah what challenge she would like to tackle, if money and time were no issue.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s coming back to the education and digital literacy,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of everything else on the agenda, I think we\u2019ve made assumptions about different generations and their understanding of what digital is. I\u2019d really like to invest that time in our patient pathways and our staff career pathways, looking at the absolute core skills are that are needed for different roles.\n\u201cIn the future, I would like to see job descriptions going out which include the digital skills that are needed for certain roles.

Digital transformation (DX) is transforming operational efficiency, and digital information is increasingly driving service delivery \u2013 from statistical analysis, all the way through to e-prescribing and secure information sharing between different disciplines and healthcare settings.\nData capture is a critical building block in digital transformation. Digital processes demand digital inputs and the processing of them in an automated and intelligent way. For effective digital transformation, project leads need to shift the focus away from traditional information capture to intelligent automation.\nWhat is intelligent automation?\nIntelligent automation starts with the nature of the inputs \u2013 while there is still a significant volume of paper-based documents flowing around organisations, there are also digital inputs on top. In many cases, some of these input streams are processed manually and/or are handled in silos \u2013 this needs to change.\nDigitisation used to be focused on converting a paper document into a digital image \u2013 just like converting a paper filing cabinet into a digital filing cabinet. While this is still important, intelligent automation sees the focus shift from the image to the data in the image, and the ability to extract this data so it can be used to drive efficiency across business workflows.\nMoreover, digital transformation across the NHS has seen data capture no longer fall under the sole purview of the back-office. Capture is now conducted at the edge \u2013 at the point it enters the organisation, and the focus has shifted from scan to archive to scan to process. Front-office staff and clinicians\u2019 capture requirements are impacted by a stronger need to simplify the process and a push to reduce manual steps, this is particularly important in capturing inputs, as achieving efficiencies here has far-reaching consequences for the automation of the entire process.\nThe path forward to a simplified process starts with intelligent automation. Once captured, digital documents enable critical information to be extracted, indexed and automatically routed to EMRs or other systems \u2013 ensuring the right information is accessible to the people that need it, when they need it.\nA specialist in data capture\nOne obstacle the NHS faces is a lack of experience in data capture, which is why many NHS trusts have chosen to partner with Kodak Alaris.\nFrom electronic patient records to streamlined administrative processes, solutions from Kodak Alaris pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and patient-centred care environment.\nScanners and intelligent document processing (IDP) software solutions from Kodak Alaris help cut unnecessary costs and save valuable time, allowing healthcare organisations to dramatically improve patient engagement with quicker access to health records, reduced wait times, and more accurate diagnostics.\nImplementing the right solution requires careful consideration of several factors, including the complexity of workflows and integration with other applications. Solutions and professional service specialists at Kodak Alaris guide customers through the process and leverage their expertise to align a client\u2019s unique environment and workflows with established best practices.\nThe starting point is to identify document processing requirements, this includes evaluating the types of documents that need to be processed, the volumes, and the average processing time involved. Kodak Alaris will then propose a solution that includes the best hardware and software solutions combined with professional services support, to ensure seamless deployment and first-class results.\nSuperior scanners and integrated software\nSuperior networked scanners from Kodak Alaris are designed to streamline business processes, making scanning and digitising high-volume projects, capturing quality images at top speed, and protecting original documents as easy as possible.\nScanners from Kodak Alaris are renowned for reliability and image quality. As a case in point, concerns raised by clinicians at Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust that finding casenotes often took too long, delaying important information needed for patient consultations, prompted the trust to create a records management system that would provide easier and faster access to patient notes to help clinicians deliver the best possible care.\nThe trust outsourced the task of back-scanning patient files to Capita TDS, who selected high performance scanners from Kodak Alaris to keep up with the system\u2019s heavy workload. As the Capita TDS Operations Manager said: \u201d Scanners from Kodak Alaris are workhorses and the best choice for our demanding environment. They can handle large volumes and are extremely robust.\u201d\nMISL, a bureau and BPO provider selected scanners from Kodak Alaris to deliver a five-year, \u00a34.5 million contract to provide document scanning services to The Royal Free, one of the most famous medical centres in the UK. Powered by five high-volume production KODAK i5600 Scanners and six KODAK i5800 Scanners, along with KODAK Capture Pro Software,\u00a0 MISL digitised The Royal Free Hospital\u2019s medical files in record time, completing the project two years ahead of schedule.\nKODAK Capture Pro Software quickly and accurately converts large volumes of paper documents into high quality images and eliminates manual data entry. Capture Pro has integration into some of the leading document management, ECM and workflow solutions on the market, is easy to use and quickly transforms data in documents into actionable digital information.\nInnovative technology\nScanners from Kodak Alaris include several innovative technologies (model specific) that ensure the most reliable and accurate data capture and the smoothest scanning experience, ensuring clients get the most out of their scanning investment.\nHighlights include:\n\nPerfect Page Technology. Perfect Page Technology uses advanced image scanning and innovative paper handling to enhance and deliver the highest-quality scanning jobs. Features such as auto-cropping, auto-orientation, colour sharpening and smoothing and streak removal ensure accurate capture at the point of data origination, providing peace of mind that onward systems are receiving the right information.\nActive Feed Technology. Active Feed Technology reduces errors and the amount of manual preparation for scanning large jobs with multiple papers. Pages don\u2019t have to be perfectly aligned when placed in the scanner\u2019s document feeder, Active Feed Technology jogs the pages to align them for error-free scanning, reducing the need to rescan due to misfeeds caused by poor alignment.\nIntelligent Document Protection. Intelligent Document Protection monitors the condition of paper being scanned using ultrasonic sensors to \u2018listen\u2019 for problems and alert the user before jams or misfeeds occur.\nEmbedded Image Processing. Embedded Image Processing on the KODAK S2000 Scanner Series removes dependence on a high-powered PC, with powerful built in processors that handle image processing at the scanner rather than the desktop. This allows the scanners to run at rated speed without any slowdown or need for host processing.\n\nIntelligent document processing\nKODAK Info Input Solution is an IDP software that automates and simplifies the journey from document arrival to usage in business processes \u2013 quickly, accurately, and reliably. Built around Kodak Alaris\u2019 unique Open Intelligence design, in which pre-built models that understand documents are immediately deployed within a workflow process, KODAK Info Input Solution integrates with industry-leading artificial intelligence tools to deliver remarkable accuracy and makes it significantly easier to extract data in a fully automated way using machine learning.\nBy bringing together decades of image science expertise, superior capture technology, sophisticated software and professional services, Kodak Alaris is well-positioned to help healthcare organisations digitise paper-based information and drive internal efficiencies to enhance patient care.\nTo find out more please visit https://bit.ly/KAHealthcare\u00a0\nRelatedGoogle Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Birmingham and Solihull ICS strategy highlights central role\u2026North Staffordshire Combined launches patient app with\u2026Royal Orthopaedic Hospital strategy highlights plans for\u2026NHSE leadership competency framework highlights need to\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Study explores potential for 999 calls to be \u201cvideo live streamed\u201d to aid response decision-making", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/12/study-explores-potential-for-999-calls-to-be-video-live-streamed-to-aid-response-decision-making/", "content": "\nA study led by the University of Surrey and funded by the NIHR has looked at the potential for technology to enable \u201cvideo live streaming\u201d of trauma incidents, with the aim of helping to support decision-making from the emergency services around response.\nEnabled by 999 callers\u2019 smartphones, the study explored the possibility that sending live video footage could make it easier to see the number and type of emergency vehicles and personnel required for major trauma incidents. The research builds on existing work with GoodSAM instant on-scene technology, which allows callers to share location and video with call handlers without needing to download an app.\nThe technology was trialled over a six-week period from June to November 2022, with 240 trauma incidents included, and footage viewed in 85 percent of calls. Changes identified in decision-making included the KSS air ambulance being stood down in two cases, \u201csaving money and enabling them to be redeployed elsewhere\u201d.\nProfessor Cath Taylor, University of Surrey, noted that with most ambulance services in the UK relying on callers to verbally relay accurate information about what happened at the scene along with the condition of the patient(s) involved, information can be unintentionally inaccurate due to shock and lack of medical knowledge. \u201cNot having correct information makes it difficult for emergency medical services to determine how many and what types of medical personnel and vehicles should be sent to the scene,\u201d she said. \u201cUsing GoodSAM could help us overcome this. However, we need to understand the practicalities of implementing and evaluating such technology within emergency services.\u201d\nProfessor Richard Lyon, University of Surrey, commented that giving dispatchers \u201ceyes on the ground\u201d could be \u201cgame-changing in helping them dispatch the appropriate response to major trauma incidents. Air ambulance services are important, scarce and expensive resources that must be tasked accurately to those patients who need them most. What we have found is live video streaming from 999 callers is feasible to implement, acceptable, and easy to use for both callers and dispatchers.\u201d\nHe highlighted a need for further research in order to better understand the impact that live streaming could have on dispatch decisions, along with whether it could potentially improve speed and accuracy of ambulance dispatch.\n\u201cWe also found it challenging to recruit 999 callers to the study,\u201d he added, \u201cand need to work with members of the public to overcome this challenge for future research, as their insight is invaluable.\u201d\nIn other news around ambulance services, in December HTN reported that The East of England NHS Collaborative Procurement Hub, in collaboration with the National Ambulance Procurement Board, has awarded a framework agreement contract to five suppliers for the provision and support of EPR systems to be utilised by ambulance services across England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Wight.\nIn October, we also covered the five-year strategy from\u00a0London Ambulance Service NHS Trust, with focus on modernising estate and infrastructure; ensuring that staff have access to digital tools to help them do their jobs; and investing in modern ways of working such as using artificial intelligence and robotic automation.\nRelatedCalderdale and Huddersfield goes live on NPIC digital\u2026Feature: making virtual wards a successNorfolk and Norwich University Hospital goes live with\u2026Two suppliers on Tech Innovation Framework on track to go\u2026Study suggests linking whole genome sequencing and clinical\u2026NHSE board explores digital portfolio with focus on FDP,\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Novari: Supporting the UK government\u2019s ambitious spring budget productivity plans and reducing NHS waiting times", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/11/novari-supporting-the-uk-governments-ambitious-spring-budget-productivity-plans-and-reducing-nhs-waiting-times/", "content": "\nContent by\u00a0Novari Health \nAs the UK government announces a significant investment in the NHS productivity plan, Novari Health, a leading provider of healthcare technology solutions, is proud to highlight how its innovative Access to Care Platform\u2122 can play a pivotal role in driving down wait times and enhancing NHS productivity across the nation.\nThe Spring Budget 2024 outlines an ambitious strategy to double down on technological and digital transformation within the NHS, backed by a \u00a33.4 billion funding injection.

She cited coronary heart disease as an example, which is believed to kill twice as many women as breast cancer; however, heart disease is often seen as a \u2018men\u2019s disease\u2019.\nWhen it comes to women-specific health issues such as miscarriage and menopause, Victoria said: \u201cThere is just not enough focus and huge amounts of stigma. Women are underrepresented in clinical trials, in education and training and in policy development.\u201d\nShe also commented on the disparities between women with regards to intersectionality, when it comes to affecting factors such as ethnicity and poverty.\nKim raised a point about the NHS workforce, noting that it is \u201cstill a very male-dominated organisation\u201d. Despite women making up nearly 70 percent of the workforce, she said, only 44 percent of CEOs are women.\nLooking at the gender gap for health on the widest possible scale, Natalie shared that when she researched the topic, she found that the UK is reported to have the 12th largest gender gap on a global scale.\nMoving onto the women\u2019s health strategy, Victoria explained that it considers women\u2019s health across the life course and centres around six key points: women\u2019s voices and contributions at policy level; improving services; addressing disparities; information and education; women\u2019s health in the workplace; and research and data.\n\u201cDigital doesn\u2019t feature that strongly within the strategy in a really obvious way, but of course digital and data underpin so much,\u201d she said.\nThe role of digital in driving change: how can technology play a role in closing the gender health gap?\nWith regards to the role tech can play, Natalie commented: \u201cWe can do a lot \u2013 we lead busy lives, and it can be hard to find the time to get an appointment, let alone attend an appointment. There can be a significant mental impact from some of these conditions on women too, and the topics are often quite personal. We\u2019ve run a lot of technologies which allow us to make healthcare more accessible remotely to help with these things, but it\u2019s also about utilising tech to catch things early \u2013 for example, we run an extensive hypertension blood pressure service up in Scotland that has 25,000 patients and 49 percent of those are women. The more we catch things early, the more we can enable women to talk about these health issues and raise awareness and knowledge.\u201d\nSally agreed, saying that her experience through her staff network and through conversations with patients highlights the need to make healthcare more accessible, rather than expecting women to fit into existing structures which might not suit. \u201cHow can we change our structure, change our delivery methods and alter our accessibility to make it easier for women? For example, we have a high percentage of part-time workers at the trust to support women who are working different hours because they\u2019re also involved in things like school runs or caring for a parent. For patients, we try to set up services so that they are there for women within the times that they are available. If they\u2019re not available, is there a digital alternative that we can use? Can we use apps, tech that women can take home with them, wearables that can report data back to us on a regular basis, to help in bridging that accessibility gap?\u201d\nKim pointed to the example of a smartphone. \u201cYou can do anything with that thing that you hold in your hand,\u201d she said, \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t underestimate that. Digital can help women to identify issues and problems, whatever they may be; you can search just about anything online and get an answer, and whilst this does have a negative side as it can cause worry and it isn\u2019t always entirely accurate, it can also provide a lot of reassurance. Digital opens us up to a huge amount of information, and that can empower women to make informed choices and have more control.\u201d\nComing back to the points around accessibility, Kim added: \u201cFor me accessibility is also around language \u2013 we use such a lot of jargon in the health service, and I think tech and the options for communicating with patients digitally offers us an opportunity to make some informed decision about the language we use.\u201d\nVictoria agreed with the points around digital supporting better access to information and education, raising the NHS website as one such source; however, she said, in order to make the most of this you need to both digital literacy and health literacy. It can be a real minefield when you are looking for consistent, well-presented, relatable information.\u201d\nShe added that she is always interested in unintended consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should assume that digital will cross the gender health gap, or enable women to access better healthcare sooner, unless we design with women, for women, by women.\u201d\nChallenges around digital healthcare for women\n\u201cSo much about the current situation we find ourselves in impacts everybody\u2019s health,\u201d said Kim, \u201cand can impact women as part of that \u2013 the cost of living crisis, for example, is having a massive impact on families. Women often put themselves last in a family and will make sure that everybody else is OK, but it\u2019s their health that suffers. I don\u2019t think we should underestimate that. There\u2019s so much bad news about, and the pressures of social media can play a role too; there\u2019s a lot of anxiety and depression linked to these factors.\u201d\nKim highlighted the disparities that can be found in research with regards to women\u2019s health. She described a piece of research that focused on a ligament issue that led to knee problems for footballers. Following intensive research, it is now known how to treat and care for this issue in male footballers; but it does not work for women footballers, because women\u2019s bodies are different and there were a lack of women included in the research. \u201cThat\u2019s just an example of how wider health issues, whilst they can affect everyone, are quite often dominated by men\u2019s research and therefore we don\u2019t always know what we need to do in terms of supporting women.\u201d\nSally said: \u201cAnother challenge in this space is that we need to ensure that digital isn\u2019t the only option. It needs to be a choice, part of a suite of options, and it needs to come with support to access it in the first place. When developing the strategic direction for my trust I have to ensure that I\u2019m not making assumption about what people have access to, because it\u2019s all well and easy to say that we\u2019ll do everything virtually because it\u2019s quicker, but that can cause a real issue. Digital by default is a lovely sentiment, but it\u2019s just that at present \u2013 a sentiment. I attended a meeting yesterday where we were looking at our areas of deprivation, and our east coast doesn\u2019t really have access to the internet yet as standard. There will be similar places across the UK. So for me the challenge isn\u2019t just about what we face; it\u2019s about challenging ourselves to not just accept a default.\u201d\nVictoria brought up femtech, and how femtech founders can find it particularly difficult to get investment for their work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done in the software space, with regards to women having a greater voice \u2013 coming back to Kim\u2019s point around the NHS being female dominated until you get to senior positions, when I worked in the digital space I was actually quite taken aback at just how male dominated that world was, as a comparison.\u201d\nNatalie agreed: \u201cThe gender gap in tech has been vast for many years. We need to make sure that whatever we build technology-wise is a foundation that can grow and develop as a service matures, as patients mature, and as conditions mature.\u201d\nShe also highlighted the need to ensure that digital services are flexible, using the example of automated phone calls for elderly patients who might struggle with technology, whereby information is read out over the phone and users can press a button for yes or a button for no.\nOn how different groups of women can face different challenges, Victoria said: \u201cWe\u2019re not homogeneous as women, and there are all sorts of factors that can have a disproportionate impact on health issues. We absolutely need to take those into account, and it comes back to co-design \u2013 building things with and for the people who will use it.\u201d\nOn this note, Victoria explained that she undertook a project for an acute NHS trust in the north west around the trust\u2019s introduction of an EPR and associated patient app. \u201cWe had a researcher sit in on clinics for the day \u2013 she sat with women attending the clinic and let them use the app, observing how they found it. We realised that if the trust was going to be successful at implementing the patient app and not creating unintended consequences of increasing inequality, they needed to have midwives onboarding women to the app. It was particularly affecting women who didn\u2019t speak English as their first language, for example.\n\u201cWhen you are thinking about implementing an application, you need to think about it in the context in which it will sit and understand the current workflow; and think about how women use technology in their everyday lives, particularly excluded women. Then you need to think about the support required in this area.\u201d\nHow digital is helping to meet women\u2019s health needs\nLooking to current projects on digital in women\u2019s health, Sally talked about how her team are keen not to \u201crun before they can walk\u201d, spending extra time to make sure they understand the tech before thinking about implementing.\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve implemented is a digital menopause service for our staff, which has helped us overcome some of the issues around access with us being such a rural region. We\u2019re about to expand it, and I\u2019m having discussions with people in the femtech arena, to find out how we can maximise the use of these clinics to help a wider group of women. Things like endometriosis, menstrual concerns, pregnancy loss, fertility; these are things that my female staff are wanting to look at, and so we\u2019re being led by them, and we\u2019re in discussions with some tech providers about how we can bring that in.\u201d\nSally added that \u201cfor those femtech companies and innovators, to have a cohort of people that will come along the journey and test things with you; the NHS are a great option for that; we have access to lots of people who will give feedback and help you on the way\u201d.\nKim also shared some insight into her recent work on digital in women\u2019s health, including on the virtual wards that her team set up about eighteen months ago.\n\u201cAbout 56 percent identify themselves as women, and actually over 60 percent are aged 75 and over, which already says something about digital skills. One of the issues we have identified is that there are some situations whereby women might be being controlled at home. So we\u2019re sending women home with kit to connect to their smartphone, and telling them how to use it, but if they\u2019re not the primary controller of that data, or of that phone, then there\u2019s an issue. We don\u2019t know how to deal with that yet, but we are mindful of it.\u201d\nThe question is also, according to Kim, whether women will be able to rest and recuperate when they get home, like they would on a ward, or whether expectations about house keeping and other duties within the home will interfere with this. With this in mind, she said that her team is \u201clooking at commissioning some evaluations to see what the outcomes are for the people that go home on virtual wards\u201d.\nVictoria discussed how proud she was of having built a very diverse team, saying, \u201cI think there is something about our role, and men as allies, in thinking about diversity in terms of recruitment, and there\u2019s those social value things you can look at when you\u2019re working on procurement\u201d.\nNatalie agreed with the need to work on ensuring diversity, saying, \u201cwe try to be as diverse as we can, and we\u2019ve developed a gestational diabetes solution for women, which has been developed by women, and that\u2019s been a great success\u201d.\nIdentifying areas with potential for digital in women\u2019s health\nNatalie noted how getting the governance in place is important when it comes to the potential for digital in women\u2019s health, and how \u201cwe need to look at getting services which are doing well, going further\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about one piece of tech, it\u2019s about the ecosystem around that technology; I don\u2019t think one partner can do everything, it\u2019s about seeing what different technologies are out there that can come together to resolve an issue around the disease, pathway or patient.\u201d\nGoing back to the women\u2019s health strategy, Victoria talked about the role that digital could play in women\u2019s health hubs, joining up services and making them easier for women to access and use.\n\u201cI think something that thinks about that life course, and thinks about the conditions and experiences that women have, helping them to navigate health services, would be a great way for health hubs to really make a difference. I\u2019d like to see them given more resources and capacity, because those two things are such an issue.\u201d\nKim discussed how she would love to see more work being done in prevention on women\u2019s health, starting from a young age, with \u201clots of work to be done around exercise, smoking, nutrition\u201d. She also talked about how from a personal standpoint, she had recently begun to look into ways of preventing dementia, but how that sort of thing should begin a lot earlier.\nGetting the information being sent out right, and achieving consistent and clinically-led messaging across platforms, would be a great use of digital in the women\u2019s health space, Sally shared.\n\u201cFor me, there\u2019s a real opportunity to use digital to share information to protect women from having to do things that may be damaging both physically and mentally, like retelling their story over and over again.\u201d\nOur panel then moved on to take questions from our live webinar audience.\nWe\u2019d like to thank all of our panellists for joining us for this session. You can watch the webinar here:\n\nIn another of our recent panels, we were joined by Liz Leggott (project manager, greener NHS champion and NHS England clinical entrepreneur at the South Yorkshire Primary Care Workforce & Training Hub) and Emma Stratful (chief operating officer at OX.DH) for a discussion on digital primary care.\u00a0Liz and Emma discussed a range of topics, from the projects they have been involved with to challenges in this space and the role of innovation in primary care.\u00a0\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "UnitedHealth targets mid-March to restore Change Healthcare systems following\u00a0ransomware group cyber attack\u00a0", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/08/unitedhealth-targets-mid-march-to-restore-change-healthcare-systems-following-ransomware-group-cyber-attack/", "content": "\nUnitedHealth Group confirmed a threat actor gained access to its tech division Change Healthcare last month, which supports pharmacies and hospitals across the US.

The first, delivery quality, sees DHCW commit to using \u201cevery means to shape, manage and deliver projects to the highest recognised standards\u201d and to utilise resources to create a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d approach; to consistently develop and improve the positive impact of digitally-enabled change; and to address shortfalls in consistency and quality across the whole digital portfolio.\nAnother principle, to inform quality, places emphasis on developing the scope and remit of resources to actively inform policy development; engaging in \u201cmeaningful development\u201d of ideas and solutions to existing and future challenges; and to collaborate to ensure that policy is developed \u201cagainst the richest and most comprehensive data\u201d available.\nDHCW also seeks to build value by assessing digital technologies and technical developments and digital competencies \u201cactively and purposefully\u201d in healthcare systems outside Wales; to adopt \u201coff the shelf\u201d products by default and conduct bespoke development only by exception; to share information with all relevant stakeholders to identify areas of potential development; and to proactively source solutions to technical and process issues through generation of innovative ideas and by challenging boundaries.\nAround the principle of \u2018guide and standardise\u2019, DHCW commits to developing, agreeing and standardising a framework detailing data management and interoperability standards to be adopted across primary care in Wales; to support this adoption process; and to guide compliance against standards as they develop with support for practices.\nThese principles tie into eight key priorities for DHCW. Around workforce, creating a product, project and programme transition team aiming to work with end users and policy leads to ensure that digital programmes bring value; develop a digital futures team to help shape technology choices; and attend clinical and managerial expert user groups focused on problem solving, in the hopes of better placing DHCW within Wales\u2019 primary care community as a strategic partner.\nOther priorities include developing health informatics research and reporting capability to enable access to information and analysis to inform decision making; extending system development capability to support new entrants into the supplier market; focusing development around building in-house connectivity to reduce dependence on third-party suppliers; developing a standards and capability function to support supplier integration, data quality and stakeholder confidence; and agreeing to a mandated process for transition into business-as-usual.\nDHCW notes that \u201cstructural, operational and cultural change\u201d is required in order to implement the strategy, and adds that moving forwards clear emphasis should be placed on the benefits to be realised and actions to be undertaken to help people \u201ctranslate strategy to their own context\u201d.\nThe strategy can be found in full here.\nLast month, we reported on DHCW\u2019s draft organisational strategy 2024-2030 which sets out out strategic objectives for digital across health and care, including infrastructure, data platform, open architecture, digital services, innovation and more.\nWe also covered how DHCW is seeking to procure a medicines information solution and drugs tool at an estimated value of more than \u00a31.4 million.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Teledermatology service supporting waiting list reductions in Cornwall", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/08/teledermatology-service-supporting-waiting-list-reductions-in-cornwall/", "content": "\nRoyal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust (RCHT) has partnered with Isla Health to offer dermatology services remotely to patients across community hospitals in Cornwall.\nPatients can be referred-in by their GP to an imaging clinic, where a medical photographer will take photographs of areas identified for concern, before those images are reviewed by a consultant using the ISLA platform the following day.\nDr Sandy Anderson, associate specialist at RCHT, noted that the region has seen \u201can epidemic of skin cancer in the last few years\u201d with the melanoma diagnosis rate in Cornwall \u201calmost three quarters of the rate in Australia\u201d.\nThis, combined with a reported shortage of\u00a0dermatologists in the UK, means that \u201cinnovating the way we work is inevitable,\u201d Sandy added.\n\u201cWe can get 150-200 referrals a week, but we know that 50 percent of those can be sent back to their GP.

They work with over 1,000 surgeries across the UK with 15 offices to enable them to provide a more localised presence for the practices they support.\nThe landscape from 2023\nDave started by looking back to 2023 to examine NHS England better purchasing framework for advanced cloud telephony, sharing insight into the work that has been happening around this over the last 12 months.\nThink Healthcare was one of the four suppliers included in the framework at the beginning of 2023, he explained; since then, those suppliers have gone through developments in technical and information governance accreditations and the supplier list has expanded significantly, with 21 now included on the framework for England.\n\u201cJust before Christmas, we went through a phase to support people on analogue technology to move up to the cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is important because all old analogue lines are going to be decommissioned in 2025. Funding was provided to help support those analogue practice within England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently looking at how to approach that.\u201d\nTowards the end of last year and the start of 2024, Dave continued, work has gone into basic system upgrades. \u201cThis means helping people who are on basic cloud technology move up to a more advanced system that is designed and tailored for the NHS.\u201d\nIn 2024, practice migrations are expected to \u201cgo into the thousands \u2013 there will be two or three thousand practices migrating within this calendar year. The big challenge for all of us, as industry and as practice owners, is: how do we make the most of this opportunity?\u201d\nAdvanced cloud telephony: how to benefit\n\u201cIf we look at our new systems and deal with them in the same way that we did our analogue systems \u2013 putting them in place and expecting to configure them in the previous style \u2013 then we really won\u2019t get the most from them,\u201d Dave stated. \u201cThere are a lot of benefits to be had if we do this right.\u201d\nDave moved on to share some of the key features that ACT can offer, as well as sharing practical tips and ideas around configuration, considerations and more.\n\u201cThere are all types of features within these systems that can be tailored and adjusted to suit your practice, your PCN or your cluster,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a particular challenge in your surgery, I would encourage you to speak to your provider \u2013 often, they\u2019ll be able to help you with a solution.\u201d\nFirstly, Dave discussed\u00a0auto-callback, calling it the \u201cnumber one feature requested by patients \u2013 patient participation groups across the country have shown real enthusiasm for this\u201d. He added that the feature doesn\u2019t have to be either on or off; it can be optimised as per a practice\u2019s wants or needs, for example by triggering the auto-callback feature for particularly busy times rather than leaving it running constantly.\n\u201cAnother feature that you can activate in some of the more advanced systems like ours, is that you can allow the patient to book a specific time for that callback. Rather than the system calling them back as soon as they get to the front of the queue, they can indicate a time that they know they will be free to talk. At the chosen time, the surgery phone will ring and relay a message to the receptionist informing them that this is a patient callback, and it will then dial that patient\u2019s number.\u201d\nOnce the system has been configured, Dave encouraged practices to promote this feature and how it is used. Additionally, he recommended\u00a0that practices engage with patients to understand current system challenges, including patient perception on current waiting times and what counts as an acceptable wait to them.\nAnother feature Dave drew attention to was patient group configurations. \u201cThough I run Think Healthcare now, I was in practice management for a number of years myself, in the home counties,\u201d Dave shared, \u201cand this is the feature that gets me the most excited with my former practice manager hat on. When you look at your buildings, we adapt everything we do to support different groups of patients and their requirements \u2013 a ramp to the front door, for example, and a hearing loop at the counter. But phone systems aren\u2019t usually adapted in the same way, they are usually a case of one size fits all. But with our system, you don\u2019t have to do that; you can tailor it to suit different needs. It\u2019s really useful for addressing things like access inequalities, which can often be difficult to tangibly change.\u201d\nIt works by enabling a search to be run within the clinical system on any group of patients. That search can then be linked into Think Healthcare and custom call flows for those different patient groups, so that when they call into the surgery, the system will recognise their phone number and react accordingly, as per the protocol that has been set up.\n\u201cThis can be configured however you want it to,\u201d Dave explained. \u201cA common example could be palliative care patients \u2013 you don\u2019t want them waiting at number 30 in the Monday morning phone queue. You could set this feature up to route these patients straight to the front of the queue when they call. Or it could be that when other GPs or paramedics call through, they can be programmed to skip the queue.\u201d\nIn terms of optimisation ideas around patient group configurations, Dave suggested looking into the people who use your surgery in order to define cohorts \u2013 for example, are there lots of people in care homes, or is there a high level of a particular clinical group? \u201cIt\u2019s probably a piece of work you\u2019ve done for total triage models anyway, so you can just replicate it from that. Once you know which groups you are targeting, you can configure it into the call flow automatically. You can also include other local services too \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to just be traditional appointment booking or prescription ordering lines, you can include any local services that you want to promote or signpost people to.\u201d\nExpanding on this point, Dave noted that it offers a way to streamline demand, by offering additional options rather than routing everyone straight through to the funnel to the reception team. \u201cYou can provide a verbal signpost to these other services, or a text message signpost \u2013 for example, you could create an SMS template in the system so that a link to a particular service can be texted through to the patient as an option.\u201d\nNext, Dave moved on to discuss federated working,\u00a0acknowledging firstly that many federated working projects are a work in progress and continually evolving, with many at different stages. \u201cThe first part of any integration project is communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is a lot that phone systems can do to support you with that. It doesn\u2019t always matter if you\u2019re on different systems to the other providers, either \u2013 in that case, I\u2019d encourage you to speak to your supplier about how they might be able to help.\u201d\nSome of the key features of this ACT offering include the ability to handle calls for multiple sites from one location, and triage scripting depending on a patient\u2019s location or the options they have chosen. \u201cYou\u2019ll always know where they are calling from and why,\u201d Dave explained, \u201cand you can then create a custom script for that call handler to run through with that patient. The idea behind this is that you can facilitate proper hub working, but still have the feel that the patient is calling an individual practice. This particular feature can be really powerful.\u201d\nVirtual care navigator\nDave turned the discussion towards Think Healthcare\u2019s recently launched virtual care navigator, described as \u201ca virtual receptionist available 24/7\u201d and one of the options for practices \u201cthinking about what\u2019s next \u2013 what is going to help you to make things easier and make things simple for patient access, on top of your existing setup?\u201d\nThe idea behind the virtual care navigator is to \u201cprovide another mechanism for patients to get support, rather than joining that bottleneck for the receptionist\u2019s attention. Like everything else in our system, the virtual care navigator is highly configurable depending on how you want to use it.\u201d\nIt includes numerous options including a \u2018check and cancel\u2019 feature, with Dave explaining: \u201cStats show that about seven percent of calls going through to reception are asking for details of their existing appointments that they have already booked, or looking to cancel. This can be automated. It is linked into your clinical system through the API, so a patient could press an option to listen to their appointment information; or press a button and it will cancel the appointment directly into the clinical system so that the appointment slot becomes available for another patient. You can configure this so that it only lets patients \u00a0cancel appointments that you have deemed appropriate \u2013 so for example if it\u2019s a chronic disease review, you might want to have a conversation with the patient rather than allowing automatic cancelling.\u201d\nThe virtual care navigator can support any type of appointment booking, and \u00a0the ordering of repeat prescriptions, with requests sent directly to the doctor\u2019s electronic prescription queue.\n\u201cThe full virtual care navigator system includes a total navigation package \u2013 you can include as many or as few of these features as you want, but the package obviously has them all. That can help to support you with local referrals, signposting, admin queries, sick note requests \u2013 lots of different things can be configured into the system.\u201d\nA key benefit here, Dave said, is that it brings a lot of the benefits from the online consultation platforms through to your phone system. \u201cThis means you can support people who are struggling with digital access, because they can do all this through the phone. You can also run the system in any language, so if you have any particular languages used within your geography, you can make sure they are included.\u201d\nPrescribing hubs\nDave also raised the concept of prescribing hubs, with anything from two practices working together to a whole ICB or health board collaborating.\n\u201cYou can set up a single phone number for patients to ring \u2013 they will call it and hear a message asking them to confirm which practice they are with, the system will recognise their response and put them straight into the prescription ordering queue for that particular practice. It provides a single point of contact for repeat prescription requests without the need for any additional input \u2013 it will build into all your existing processes and workflows. This can be particularly powerful at PCN level and upwards.\u201d\nMany thanks to Dave for taking the time to share his insight and tips.\nRelatedHywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026SBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Interview: \"It's about opening up opportunities to get to\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for virtual care", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/07/htn-at-hett-north-2024-tackling-ai-risks-and-tips-for-virtual-care/", "content": "\nWe rounded off our February with a visit to Healthcare Excellence Through Technology (HETT) North, bringing together professionals to discuss health tech topics.\nWe attended a variety of sessions to hear views and discussions \u2013 here are some of our highlights.\nArtificial intelligence: how to mitigate risk and building trust for the future\nThe Digital Maturity Forum was home to a host of discussions and debates around digital in health, including AI in clinical safety, the impact of digital on pathway improvement and preventative care, and putting trust in AI.\nOne panel discussed AI in clinical safety and how to mitigate risks when integrating AI for the positive benefit of patients, with panellists including\u00a0Keith Gomes Pinto (NHS Dorset), Dean Mawson (Leadership Committee for Clinical Safety at the Faculty of Clinical Informatics), Lucy George (AstraZeneca UK) and Avi Mehra (Doctorpreneurs).\nThe panel first identified challenges in this space, such as keeping pace with the rapid expansion of AI and new AI capabilities, lack of regulation or compliance with AI clinical safety standards, delays in introducing incident reporting mechanisms, and\u00a0the knowledge gap existing relating to AI standards and regulations.\nOn things that need to change in the clinical AI space, Dean urged manufacturers and developers to work with clinicians and patients, whilst Avi talked about regulating use cases, rather than the technology or overarching principles. From a big pharma perspective, Lucy talked about how, in the regulatory landscape, she had been working toward encouraging simplicity in frameworks and emerging AI.\nThe panel offered advice to anyone looking to start their implementation of AI, with Keith referring back to enterprise architecture, highlighting the best process as defining your need, involving the right stakeholders, building your requirements, and then going to procurement. \u201cWe can be gateway keepers to assuring that that tool is safe,\u201d he said. Dean\u2019s advice was to invest in a business analyst, as he noted that a lot of the surfacing work needs to be done up front.\nOn building trust in AI applications for the future, we heard from Dr Salah Ghazal Hammouche, ST8 Trauma and Orthopaedics, Clinical AI Fellow & Topol Digital Health Fellow at Imperial College London. Salah discussed the lack of economic evaluations of AI products along with the need to conduct post-market surveillance on AI applications, assessing them against set criteria, and providing databases to help clinicians assess.\nHe also noted that ensuring safety in AI should include effective validation, taking steps to reduce bias, and introducing benchmarking and post-deployment evaluation measures.\nVirtual care: pathways and outcomes\nDuring our visit to HETT, we listened to\u00a0Sue Armstrong from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust as she discussed the Leicester Atrial Fibrillation (AF) virtual ward as a blueprint for digitally enabled acute care in AF.\nSue highlighted the process that the trust had followed, starting with a clinical audit, establishing a framework, linking in with the local CCG who provided funding for proof of concept, developing a platform to manage patients supported by an IT project manager, and working on a pathway for AF patients.\nOnce assigned to the pathway, Sue shared how patients are given pulse oximeters and blood pressure monitor, which are integrated into a software platform, where patients can also send messages, have video consultations and \u201cbe managed how they want to be managed\u201d.\nSue went on to share some of the outcomes from the programme, describing how it has an average stay of 13 days, with only 18 out of 332 patients requiring readmission.\nShe also briefly touched upon ongoing challenges with integrating systems and making sure everyone has access to relevant information, as well as getting clinician support in trusting the pathway.\nTo close the day, we attended a panel presented by Cathy Salisbury (Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust); Kathryn Best (Fylde Coast Medical Services); and a team from Alder Hey Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust including Jemma Blake, Wendy Blumenow and Alan Bridge.\nCathy and Kathryn spoke first on their experience of remote care and virtual wards in paediatrics at Blackpool Teaching Hospitals, supporting children to recover in their own homes, taking referrals from children\u2019s acute wards and tertiary partners such as Alder Hey and Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital. After referral, children go through a consultation to ensure that they are the right fit for virtual wards, before they are given the equipment and taught how to use it, enabling them to complete their monitoring at home.\nGetting support for the pathway was identified as a challenge by Cathy and Kathryn, and they spoke about how they focused on raising awareness wherever possible, developing clear guidance, having a clear safety net in place to step back up to acute care if needed, and ensuring clear responsibilities were set out from the beginning.\nWendy and Alan then took over to talk about their experience at Alder Hey, leveraging data to help meet patient needs without bringing them back for face-to-face appointments, using patient-submitted data to improve care pathways, and to ensure that patients receive the right care, at the right time.\nThey next presented some statistics showing that at Alder Hey, their ISLA platform has been rolled out across 28 specialities, with more than 27,000 submissions in total. Wendy shared that the solution has had a positive impact on\u00a0waiting time for face-to-face appointments.\nAlan next talked about using ISLA in surgical site infections surveillance monitoring, with results including a 58 percent reduction in emergency department attendances, and a 100 percent decrease in readmissions.\nJemma went on to highlight about Little Hearts at Home, Alder Hey\u2019s remote monitoring platform allowing young children to be discharged home, with community nurses inputting data which is visible straight away to digital teams. Cardiologists can set parameters using the platform, to ensure that deteriorations are picked up quickly, which Jemma highlighted as important in the platform\u2019s success.\n\u00a0\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024HTN at Rewired 2024: what does the future hold for the NHS\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Government announces budget for long term growth including funding for NHS digital transformation", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/06/government-announces-budget-for-long-term-growth-including-funding-for-nhs-digital-transformation/", "content": "\nThe \u2018Budget for Long Term Growth\u2019 has been announced today by the UK government, sharing plans for the NHS to receive a \u00a32.5 billion day-to-day funding boost for 2024/25 along with \u00a33.4 billion in capital investment over the forecast period \u201cto invest in new tech and digital transformation\u201d.\nThe plan highlights a focus on investing in new technologies such as AI to help unlock productivity savings, replacing \u201coutdated\u201d IT systems, freeing up frontline workers from \u201ctime-consuming admin tasks\u201d and making the NHS App a \u201csingle front door for patients\u201d.\nThe government states that this investment, alongside the \u00a32.5 billion cash injection, \u201cmeans the NHS can commit to delivering \u00a335 billion in productivity savings\u201d by 2030.

Kalle discussed the health tech provider\u2019s offering, work in the UK and beyond, and aspirations for the future.\nHi Kalle! Can you tell me a bit about your role and background?\nI\u2019ve been with the company for two years now; my background was in physics and coding before I decided to pursue a clinical career. I became a senior consultant and associate professor of reconstructive surgery.\nFor the last 10 years or so I have been in management, mostly in healthcare organisations in the Nordics though I have also worked in the UK, the US and in Taiwan. Prior to this role, I was chief operating officer at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.\nLivi\u2019s beginnings and aims\nOur CEO Johannes Schildt started the company in 2015 from the angle of being a patient after noticing more and more troubling accessibility in Sweden, and on a wider basis across Europe. He had foresight, but I think the situation has certainly worsened since then, and he developed a technical solution to hold digital consultations with patients via video for certain \u00a0aspects of healthcare.\nIn the first years, he found that it wasn\u2019t difficult to get patients to adopt the tech \u2013 they liked it, and they found that it did help them with better access to care. It was encouraging to see that many of the conditions that patients were presenting with could be handled perfectly well using digital means. There was a high level of patient satisfaction from the start. But in the early days clinicians were quite hesitant, because moving towards a more digital, remote style of care when your training as a clinician revolves around direct contact and physical touch, was different.\nWhen the COVID pandemic happened it suddenly became accepted that digital was, and is, an integral part of healthcare for most conditions. It was no longer debated. Livi was one of the organisations at the forefront when it came to providing digital care and healthtech in Europe. We had significant scale, operating in Sweden and Norway as Kry, and in France and the UK as Livi. We had delivered 10 million patient appointments and we were seeing more and more clinicians coming to work for us. In the UK we are proud that in just a few years we are the only digital-first healthcare provider to be rated \u2018outstanding\u2019 by the CQC.\nWe have proven that digital can enable better access. But now we want to go deeper. We don\u2019t believe there is such a thing as digital or physical healthcare; it\u2019s just healthcare. In the future, all healthcare journeys, for every \u00a0patient, will have digital components and physical components. Digital when needed and physical when necessary. A combined digital-physical healthcare model is the solution to the challenges of healthcare systems and how they can improve efficiency and lower costs of care.\nLivi\u2019s offering and benefits\nThe Nordics is our most mature market where we have about 25 percent of the population registered with us. In principle our offering is similar across our markets, but I\u2019ll focus on the UK offering for now.\nWe partner with integrated care systems or boards, or with practices, and we share the patient load with them. In some cases, we have a relationship with an ICS or practice that is technology-led, where they are using Livi\u2019s tech; in other cases, we might be provisioning care for them with digital appointments. Sometimes it\u2019s both. It\u2019s worth saying that we do always have some relationship with the practice, even if we are commissioned at a higher level.\nIt means that a patient who is struggling to access care \u2013 for example, finding it difficult to get a GP appointment because the practice is overburdened or facing a workforce shortage \u2013 can receive care under our umbrella, in partnership with their clinic. Depending on the agreement we have with our partners, the patient might come directly to Livi for their healthcare needs, or they can be booked into our services by the ICS or the practice, so they are always in control.\nWe have about 60 physical units in Sweden and France, \u00a0as well as our website and app, so patients can choose how they access us depending on what is needed for their visit. We can also offer continuity for patients, with fast access to the clinician who has treated them before or perhaps someone from that clinician\u2019s team, if the individual is not directly required. There\u2019s a lot of choice, depending on need; a nurse visit is often a good option for patients requiring a check up, for example, or a mental health practitioner could be the ideal connection for a patient.\nIn terms of numbers, we have about 450 clinicians working for us in the UK and we work across approximately 1,500 practices. So far, we\u2019ve delivered just over two million consultations and can cover over 11 million NHS patients.\nAI and future of health\nWith regards to the innovative technologies that we hear so much about these days, we are using AI in production \u2013 but we focus on utilising technology to remove administration from clinicians, not to replace them or replace their decision-making. That is a very clear distinction.\nEssentially, we are providing an ecosystem of healthcare in close partnership with the healthcare systems in each market. We always operate with them, as a partner \u2013 we don\u2019t work in parallel to them, trying to take their patients from them and try to treat them on our own. It\u2019s all about the partner relationship between Livi and the organisation, ultimately so that we can help to increase capacity for them at a lower cost. The NHS does not have a quality problem; it\u2019s a great organisation and has been for many years, with high trust and a very well-trained clinical workforce. It really is a problem of capacity.\nThat\u2019s a main benefit to the NHS, that they pay less for gaining more capacity. For the patient, it means more accessibility and more options for their care needs. For clinicians working for us there is the flexibility to work in a digital setting, and I think it also provides an opportunity to work within a strong and trusted community of high quality care.\nDigital health: Nordics and the UK\nThere used to be notable differences in patient attitudes to digital health, but I think it has become more similar over recent times. The Nordics were quite mature, quite early on; so a couple of years ago, digital health was already well established and patients were already viewing it in a positive light. Now, I think we are getting there in France and the UK as well, although it is less widespread. They are bigger countries than the Nordics; but percentage wise I think fewer clinicians and patients understand what digital can offer.\nIt comes back to that opportunity for clinicians to work within a community, too \u2013 Livi doesn\u2019t face a recruitment challenge within the UK in terms of bringing a GP workforce on board, rather the opposite. And many work with us and stay in the NHS \u2013\u00a0 they have flexibility.\nIn terms of our ambitions within the UK market; we already are a large partner of the NHS, but we want to be a bigger partner. We have the technology, we have the quality, we have the network of GPs and clinicians who work with us; we have all of these aspects in place. We can really make a difference for the NHS in tackling the current challenges around capacity, waiting times and access for patients.\nPriorities for the immediate future\nBy March/April 2024, we will start offering in the UK what we are already offering in France and Sweden \u2013 a complete package, a \u2018virtual practice partner\u2019. Through this, we can support communication with patients regardless of the EMR system that the partner organisation sits in; insights and reporting; digital consultation; consultation reminders; remote patient monitoring and patient questionnaires; and a tailored patient app for NHS partners. It will be fully in control of the NHS partner organisation, fully in their service.\nThis package can be there when they need it; they can offload when additional capacity is required, either on a regular basis or an intermittent basis. We think of it as a one-stop-shop for expanding healthcare capacity for primary care.\nLooking ahead: Livi in 10 years\nIn 10 years\u2019 time, we would want to be the largest primary care provider in Europe and continue to provide care of the highest quality. We want to employ clinicians all over Europe \u2013 right now, we employ around 5,000 clinicians, and I think we should at least double that.\nWe want to be the company, in partnership with our public sector, that has changed healthcare into something that is no longer plagued by capacity problems in so many countries, but is a working, functional system.\nFor us to be part of helping that as much as we can, there are two policy-related areas that we would like to see improved. One is speed, the ability to get the APIs that we need and connect to partner infrastructure at a much faster pace.\nAlso, there is no national billing system in the UK. It is not in itself necessary, but there should be ways of how you can partner at scale. Most partnerships, currently, tend to be sub-scale; you\u2019ll have a lot of small partnerships rather than one major overarching one. It\u2019s great being able to help out different places with capacity little by little, but if we were to have conversations with the NHS about how we could help with this at a larger scale, that would make a difference to how fast we can increase scale and capacity within the UK system.

Used in more than 493 practices to date, Lydia shared with us some insight on how Healthtech-1\u2019s solutions can offer functionality that helps save GP time.\nIntroducing herself and the company, Lydia shared:\u00a0\u201cAs a GP by background and founding clinician at Healthtech-1, I have been on quite an interesting journey, and all of it centres around this very personal mission that I\u2019m on to change the way we work in primary care for the better of staff and patients. 6-7 years ago, I became the original clinical lead at Accurx, helping build their text messaging and Florey products, and worked with the incredible team there for nearly two years before founding my own company to automate admin in primary care. After going back to general practice, I found Healthtech-1, our missions aligned, and here I am.\u201d\nOn the background of Healthtech-1, Lydia talked about the company\u2019s journey with co-founders Raj and Pete, and the fact that the company\u2019s office is based in a GP surgery owned by Raj\u2019s parents.\n\u201cThe whole company grew out of Raj and Pete, who were childhood friends, being asked by Raj\u2019s parents to help to digitise their practice, and we\u2019ve grown from there. We\u2019ve built a great team, including Dr Dom, who\u2019s a GP but also engineers on our team; Mike, who is an ex-engineer from Accurx that helped build the COVID vaccine booking platform, the triage platform, the batch messaging; and an old friend of mine, Laurence, who is an ex-co-founder of Accurx and is now a senior lead on our engineering team.\u201d\nBringing automation into primary care\nLydia talked about Healthtech-1\u2019s focus on automation in new patient registrations and lab result filing, sharing some statistics that show that the company is now responsible for around 10 percent of the nation\u2019s registrations, and noting that the company has been selected as a supplier by the NHS central team to automate the NHS national form.\nMoving on to talk about some examples of the ways we already use automation in our everyday lives, such as when ordering food shopping online, or when using Siri to set alarms or reminders; Lydia highlights that automation is \u201ceverywhere\u201d, and is about \u201cmaking our lives easier, more enjoyable and actually more tailored, as well.\u201d\n\u201cWe want automation in primary care to save admin and clinical time, to save staff members from doing repetitive manual tasks, and to get them working on tasks that really matter, spending time on providing that quality care. We don\u2019t want practice staff to experience decision fatigue, and applying best practice every single time is made easy through automation. We can automate things like checklists that make our work safe, and can also realise financial benefits from using automation to increase efficiency.\u201d\nLydia told us that one of the main motivations for practices to choose to work with Healthtech-1 is workload.\n\u201cA good example is the national registration form that has opened up channels for a lot of practices, who are now getting lots of PDFs through their email, and who then have to have their team manually entering that data. If we can automate that, we can save time. Another great example is staffing gaps, like at Christmas, where a lot of practices we work with struggle, but by bringing in automation it brought a lot of resilience to their teams. Through these time savings and efficiencies, our practices have described boosting list size, or having more time to tick-off QOF boxes, which helps with income and optimising your quarterly capitation payments if you have same day registrations.\u201d\n\u201cCollectively, our practices have saved 93,000 hours of staff time, or over 45 years\u2019 worth of administration work, for practices across the country, which is a huge achievement.\u201d\nRealising patient benefits\nLydia moved on to discuss the use of automation in new patient registrations, and how Healthtech-1\u2019s registration form offers a secure, configurable way for practices to get new patients onto their system.\n\u201cPatients can access it through your website or via a QR code on your front desk, and the automation registers that patient in your clinical system, whether that\u2019s EMIS or SystmOne, and does all of the coding associated with that registration, getting patients registered same day, in about 10 hours. The practice team can then manage registrations from the hub, and there aren\u2019t registrations sitting in an inbox somewhere for weeks on end. You can also get so many more data points added to your record, on things like ethnicity, language needs, and so on, and uplift your processes around things like child safeguarding by flagging higher risk registrations, and getting school details in the record.\u201d\n\u201cWe built this product with our users, and we can give you a real insight into your own data. The whole onboarding process can be completed in as little as 30 minutes to go live with automated registrations. We\u2019ve roughly halved the cost of manual registrations to around \u00a32 plus VAT per registration, with no setup fees, training fees, or licence fees. We have no long-term contracts, and we do offer a free trial as well, so you can try us and see what you think. We hope to offer an average 10k list size practice an income benefit over the course of the year of around \u00a33,000.\u201d\nHighlighting use cases\nLydia introduced Patrick Denston, business manager at Alexander House Surgery, and David Gunion, digital programme manager at Sunderland GP Alliance, to talk a little bit about their own journey with automation.\nFrom his experience of automating registrations, David shared that his team had already been looking into creating a digital front door and enhancing practice websites, and that the decision to try automation was borne from a desire to improve access for patients, save time for practice, and lower costs.\n\u201cHaving the website work completed, we moved everybody onto a single supplier platform, and that gave us massive amounts of data, and we could suddenly start seeing aggregated data across the city. From an RPA (robotic process automation) point of view, we looked at key things that everybody goes to a practice website for, like appointments, prescriptions, sick notes; registrations were also in that list. We looked at how we could make changes around those things, got introduced to Lydia, and then that kind of snowballed.\u201d\n\u201cIt absolutely improves access for patients, because it\u2019s just a click of a button from the website. We do about 26,000 registrations per year, on average, which takes about 6,500 hours of staff time doing it manually, and it made sense to look at how we could reduce that time. Now that automating that has worked, we\u2019re starting to think about other things that we could maybe do to reduce that workload burden.\u201d\nOn the concerns around automation before the project got going, David shared that feedback suggested that there were worries about how the process worked and how it would impact practice.\n\u201cA lot of it was, \u2018I\u2019m just happy with what we\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s easier just to keep what I\u2019ve got, rather than change\u2019, which is fine, but it\u2019s the demand from the patient almost that drives that. We looked at it as a federation, and what we needed to do to achieve what we wanted over the next 12 months. We\u2019re still in that pilot stage, we\u2019re about 8 months in now, but key things for us to think about were people adopting the software, completing the training, and how we get practices to do that; that\u2019s the first hurdle. Feedback so far is that it\u2019s a really good product, people like it, and it\u2019s saving them time, so that\u2019s the important thing. We\u2019re also looking at engagement, so more people are aware that they can register online.\u201d\nDavid shared with us that about 26 of his practices were live with automated registrations at the moment, with plans for the remainder to be onboarded by the end of the 12 month period.\n\u201cThe speed of registrations is actually ramping up, because we\u2019re getting more practices on board, and people are starting to see the benefits. From an onboarding point of view, it\u2019s very simple, and then Healthtech-1 help complete the back-end stuff, so that\u2019s all taken care of as well. We\u2019ve done about 4,500 registrations to date, and we had a big spike at university intake time, and that\u2019s meant around 1,100 hours of staff time saved.\u201d\nPatrick shared his insights from a practice level, saying that after coming across Healthtech-1, he had chatted to his admin team to find out what the registration process currently looked like, and that they had highlighted the workload around these registrations and what it meant for them in terms of struggling to get through them all. After weighing up the costs and benefits, the practice decided they should \u201cgive it a try\u201d.\n\u201cWe thought we were spending 15 minutes on registrations, but we realised that once you start asking all the other questions, the other 96 points of data, not just the purple form; it was coming up to nearly half an hour to get everything you needed, and then there\u2019s the follow up. It\u2019s quite a lot of work, and it\u2019s not really skilled work. There was some hesitation that we might be stopping older people being able to join, but I\u2019ve just had a look at my stats, and I think the oldest person that\u2019s used it so far is 103 years old!\u201d\n\u201cIt can be any time of the day, and it even registers over the weekend, so it\u2019s all sorted by Monday morning. We\u2019ve got their medications, we can have an appointment, we can send to the GP, we can get them in for anything that they might need. That \u2018sorry we\u2019re still waiting for records, we\u2019ve emailed your previous GP practice, I know it\u2019s been weeks\u2019, has just gone away. The GPs love it because of the speed, especially with the more vulnerable patients, and equally with newborns \u2013 patients are registering when they\u2019re still in hospital, and their children are not even registered as being born yet.\u201d\nOnboarding and outcomes\nPatrick talked about the ease with which his practice completed the onboarding process, with ongoing support available from Healthtech-1 making it \u201clike having another member of the team\u201d.\nOn the time saved since implementation, Patrick shared that his team have finished QOF ahead of the April deadline, and now have much more time to provide better patient care.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our NHS health checks through the roof, we\u2019ve started next year\u2019s QOF work to get it out of the way, and we hadn\u2019t quite appreciated how much time was wasted chasing registrations.\u201d\nWhen looking at value returned on investment, Patrick highlighted that previously, \u201cthe unpredictability of when the registrations came in, and wanting to have a quick turnaround, generally meant that there was almost a blank cheque for overtime\u201d, which has since \u201cvanished\u201d.\nLab reports\nLydia\u2019s next few slides covered Healthtech-1\u2019s functionality in terms of lab reports, detailing how the automation scans inboxes for lab reports it is allowed to file, using a hard-programmed protocol, leaving an audit trail in the hub for GPs to choose to check the work it has done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re live in 22 practices including Patrick\u2019s, and we\u2019ve started with things that a lot of practices are asking HCAs and administrators to file with a protocol. We\u2019ve started with those results, because we know that they are lower complexity and lower risk, but we can do things like vitamin D, and if there\u2019s insufficiency we can read and interpret that report, text patients asking them to go and pick up a supplement from the pharmacy, save a consultation note, and we can file that result with a comment or with a task.\u201d\n\nIn the future, examples of more complex actions that the automation will complete include adding SNOMED codes, calculating Qrisk score, requesting prescriptions, reading medical records, requesting blood tests and sending emails; but Lydia emphasises that her team are keen \u201cnot to run before they can walk\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re purposefully doing things slow, starting with the lower risk things, so that we can prove that we have the responsibility, the reliability, and can be trusted to file these results. What we\u2019ll be working on soon are the more complex results, and we\u2019re taking more time to make sure these protocols are watertight, that everyone\u2019s happy with them, we\u2019re getting them signed off by GPs.\u201d\nIn terms of cost, Lydia emphasises the company\u2019s commitment to making everything \u201ccheaper, faster, and safer than current processes\u201d.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll always be able to rely on the fact that our price point is set below what it would cost you to pay one of your team members to do this work. At the moment, those less complex results will be priced at 20p per lab report; to put this into perspective, if we were to do all 200 labs that your practice receives per day, it would cost \u00a340.\u201d\nLydia then moved on to take questions from our live webinar audience.\nWe\u2019d like to thank the panel for taking the time to share their insights with us.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026NHSE shares update on metrics for urgent and emergency care\u2026Digital Health and Care Wales 2024-2027 primary care\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "NHSE leadership competency framework highlights need to recognise and champion digital, data and tech", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/05/nhse-leadership-competency-framework-highlights-need-to-recognise-and-champion-digital-data-and-tech/", "content": "\nNHS England has published a leadership competency framework for board members, setting out the need to \u201crecognise and champion\u201d developments in data, digital and technology in order to support long-term transformation.\nThe framework centres around six leadership competency domains, including driving high-quality and sustainable outcomes; setting strategy and delivering long-term transformation; promoting equality and inclusion; providing robust governance and assurance; creating a compassionate culture; and building trusted relationships with partners and communities.\nDigital is noted to have particular importance for the second of these domains, with the framework stating that \u2018good\u2019 looks like board members setting strategies for long-term transformation that \u201cbenefits the whole system and reflects best practice, including maximising the opportunities offered by digital technology.\u201d Additionally, when developing strategies boards should utilise relevant data including workforce intelligence, quality, performance finance, and take into account \u201cproven innovation and improvement processes\u201d.\nAs a leader, board members should work to ensure that strategies are informed by outside environments including technological.

In the coming year, there are plans to include five further specialties including mental health, dermatology and ephrology.\nAdditionally, the report shares that GeNotes app is in development, with a pilot project seeking to syndicate GeNotes content into GP systems is to run later this year.\nRegarding improving access to specialist care, treatment and drugs, DHSC emphasises that understanding patient data will facilitate access to treatments and care. With NCARDRS (National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Services) already collecting data on people with rare diseases, including from highly specialised services, the report highlights that discussions are underway with other such services to establish further dataflows.\nA rare disease prevalence tool is \u201cunder development\u201d, the report continues, which will look to increase transparency and improve understanding of the rare diseases currently included in NCARDRS data. A first iteration is to be published early this year.\nDHSC notes that a digital patient self-reporting interface was developed, \u201cbut unfortunately taken down shortly after launch due to issues with platform compatibility\u201d. An email-based self-reporting mechanism is in place in the interim, to allow patients to self-report symptoms; 105 patients are said to have self-referred at the time of publication.\u00a0Over the coming year, there are plans to re-establish a digital self-reporting platform.\nOn the topic of\u00a0national and international collaboration around rare disease care, DHSC states that the UK \u201cis committed to building national and international connectivity so that data and expertise can be shared for benefit of people living with rare diseases\u201d, and continues to support the development of the Global Network for Rare Diseases. A \u201ckey function\u201d of this network will be a digital platform designed to \u201cenable cross-border virtual advice and consultation\u201d.\nThe report can be accessed in full here.\nIn November, we highlighted a study undertaken by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research, London, which explored the effectiveness of AI in tailoring treatment for some sarcoma patients and to help\u00a0diagnose subtypes of rare disease.\nLast month, we also reported on research focusing on identifying the potential benefits of linking whole genome sequencing data to real-world clinical data, to identify changes in cancer DNA that \u201cmay be relevant for an individual patient\u2019s care\u201d.\nRelatedGoogle Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026NHS England plans to roll out AI to help reduce\u2026HTN Now: NW London's digital access e-hub for consultations\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024HTN at Rewired 2024: what does the future hold for the NHS\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "2024/25 GP contract places focus on role of data from digital telephony systems", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/04/2024-25-gp-contract-places-focus-on-role-of-data-from-digital-telephony-systems/", "content": "\nNHS England has published the arrangements for the GP contract in 2024/25, highlighting changes around the data from digital telephony systems and vaccinations services as well as the need to use digital tools to identify catchment areas.\nIn 2024/25 practices will be required to provide data on eight metrics around digital telephony with the aim of using the data to support service improvement and planning, particularly around supporting better understanding of overall demand ahead of next winter.\nThe provision of this data is to be mandated from October 2024 in order to \u201callow practices time to review and understand their own data before it is shared\u201d, with the metrics including call volume; calls abandoned; call time to answer; missed call volumes; wait time before calls abandoned; call backs requested; call backs made; and average call length time.\nThe updated contract also highlights that GP practices will be required to use digital tools provided by NHSE to reproduce a digital copy of their practice boundary, with a need to review and potentially update GP practice boundaries \u201cwhere data quality is insufficient for the intended purpose\u201d. Additionally, NHSE notes that practices will need to produce a digital copy of their agreed boundary where new practices are established or merged, or where a change to catchment area is agreed.\nNHSE shares an overview of priority domains for the modern general practice access model, with \u201cbetter digital telephony\u201d as a key focus. All PCNs should have a digital telephony solution implemented, the update states, including call back functionality, and data from the systems should be routinely used to support capacity and demand planning along with quality improvement.\nAnother priority is \u201csimpler online requests\u201d, with NHSE stating that online consultations should be available for patients to make administrative and clinical requests at least during core hours.\nThe role of data is also highlighted around vaccinations and immunisations, with the GP contract to be changed over 2024/25 so that practices are required to share vaccination status with local child health information services, and support these services in data cleansing; and improve data recording of vaccination status for all patients. Here, the update also notes a need to improve data quality for vaccination events, \u201csupported through a rationalisation of SNOMED codes used for vaccination event recording. following an impact assessment by NHS England\u201d.\nAlso on data, NHSE adds that practices and PCNs will be required to submit workforce information on a quarterly basis to the national workforce reporting service.\nThe contract can be found in full here.\nLast week, HTN hosted a discussion on digital primary care, with the conversation including current use cases of tech in this space, present challenges and thoughts for the future.\nIn February, we explored the latest board papers from NHS England in which the digital portfolio across the NHS was discussed, including primary care, the federated data platform.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Panel discussion: digital primary care \u201cSmall incremental steps will lead to bigger and better changes\u201d", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/04/panel-discussion-digital-primary-care-small-incremental-steps-will-lead-to-bigger-and-better-changes/", "content": "\nWe were recently joined by Liz Leggott (project manager, greener NHS champion and NHS England clinical entrepreneur at the South Yorkshire Primary Care Workforce & Training Hub) and Emma Stratful (chief operating officer at OX.DH) for a discussion on digital primary care.\u00a0\nLiz and Emma discussed a range of topics, from the projects they have been involved with to challenges in this space and the role of innovation in primary care.\u00a0\nWe began by asking our panellists to offer a brief introduction to themselves and their role. Liz kicked us off, sharing how her team at South Yorkshire Primary Care Workforce & Training Hub have been considering the ways they could potentially get their workforce up to date with digital skills.\u00a0\n\u201cI used my practice manager background, my facilities background, and my project manager background, to try and find out what we need to do as a hub to get us to a point where we are digitally adept,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing some good quality training, and we\u2019re hitting the targets of the long-term workforce plan \u2013 it\u2019s exciting work, and I\u2019m happy that I can do it.\u201d\u00a0\nAt OX.DH, Emma has been working on building digital health infrastructure, with the company starting out in assisted reproduction space and developing an end-to-end clinical solution to support the workflow for both clinical staff and patients. This was then adapted to create OX.gp, a GP foundation solution.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are part of the NHS tech innovation framework, so we\u2019re working very closely with NHS England to develop the next generation of primary care infrastructure,\u201d said Emma. \u201cWe are integrating extensively across the NHS ecosystem, looking at e-referrals, prescribing, and integrating with summary care records GP to GP. At the moment we\u2019re focusing on interoperability, a primary care challenge we\u2019re addressing.\u201d\u00a0\nHealth tech for primary care in practice\u00a0\nLiz shared how her organisation has utilised virtual reality to help reception staff deal with challenging situations, such as cases where a patient might have got agitated or angry. \u201cIt involves a body-swap piece of software with a virtual reality headset, whereby users can go through different scenarios on a given topic. There is a patient avatar that has been programmed to give you signals that you need to react to. For example, there\u2019s one on body language; if someone is getting anxious or angry, how are you going to calm them down? There\u2019s another about recognising your own anxiety and how you are reacting to this patient, so that one focuses on breathing techniques and centring yourself.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen they first tried out this software, Liz continued, only about 50 percent of the group wanted to have a go. \u201cWe assumed they\u2019d be excited to try it out \u2013 so that was an example of needing to rethink how we approached it. The next time we did it, we tried a different topic but used the same software and we had a 95 percent uptake. I think sometimes it is about having a little more exposure, and also every time we do something, we learn something different.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re now trying to get a game on the headset, so if somebody is still new to a headset they can get used to it by just doing a very simple action on a game, on an app. Sometimes the headsets don\u2019t suit everybody, and people might get motion sickness, so we need to make sure we\u2019ve got a different method of access for them; same software, same experience, just a different way of accessing it.\u201d\u00a0\nEmma picked up on the point about patient frustration, acknowledging that dealing with this can be challenging for staff. She noted that technology needs to enable workflows that will support those on the frontline, and grant access for patients through digital means before they get into the practice.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are online tools you can use to answer questions that patients might have, and tools that can support practices in looking after cohorts of patients with long-term conditions, sending patient-reported outcomes measures via text message and then feeding that information back to the practice, for example those with respiratory disease. It\u2019s really looking into where those peaks in demand are in a practice, and having the technology there to support it, making things easier and more streamlined, so staff don\u2019t have to log into numerous different systems to be able to look at one patient view.\u201d\u00a0\nLiz considered that in the future there would be space for doing something like this with patient wearable tech, feeding information back into the system and making it easier for practices to manage long-term conditions, saying, \u201cI\u2019d love to see something like that added in, so we\u2019ll see\u201d.\u00a0\nChallenges in the digital primary care space\u00a0\nDiscussing some of the challenges in the digital primary care space, Emma mentioned issues relating to tech and integration, as well as the need for testing and validation for new technologies.\u00a0\n\u201cIf we can get through that challenge, then there\u2019s the issue of deployment,\u201d she stated. \u201cIf practices have been using the same technology for 20 years, it\u2019s a sea change for them, and that can be difficult. We are trying to make that transition easier. There needs to be buy-in from practices that are already under so many constraints and resource limitations, so it has to be done in collaboration, helping people to understand the benefits.\u201d\u00a0\nLiz agreed that culture change was often difficult to achieve, but that \u201cif we\u2019re using that technology and it becomes everyday, then we hope that that will transfer across to any other piece of technology that comes their way\u201d. She also highlighted the challenges with meeting the long-term workforce plan, particularly around overcrowding and with new roles coming in which \u201chave to sit somewhere\u201d, adding more pressure to primary care.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re looking at around technology is how we can create a virtual nurse placement,\u201d Liz shared. \u201cWe were aiming for 70 \u2013 80 percent of the placement to be digital, and the rest of it to be face-to-face. It\u2019s not about simulated hours; those are different to virtual reality. That\u2019s another challenge around terminology \u2013 it can be difficult explaining to someone exactly what it is we will be doing, and how it ticks boxes for primary care.\u201d\u00a0\nThe role of ICBs and PCNs in supporting digital transformation\u00a0\nOn the role of ICBs and PCNs in supporting digital transformation, Emma highlighted that ICBs are still relatively new and finding their feet, meaning there are \u201cstill some challenges around getting buy-in across the whole of the region, and in aligning purchasing power\u201d.\u00a0\nShe continued: \u201cAre you buying technology for the whole of the ICB, when not everybody wants it? You\u2019ve got a mix of services across different regions and there are may be boundaries in terms of delivery of care. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, ICBs in general can be very difficult to understand, because they all operate slightly differently. How they assess and procure is quite challenging, too; in theory ICBs can pick things up and decide to give it a go and pilot something \u2013 but again, piloting comes back to an issue of resourcing.\u201d\u00a0\nLiz agreed, adding that governance around different suppliers can be challenging. She noted that when she had first started, it was difficult to know where to start because there were so many suppliers wanting to work with the NHS.\u00a0\nOn the South Yorkshire region, she continued, there is a chief clinical information officer in place, and some of the PCNs have a digital transformation lead. \u201cThere\u2019s work beginning to happen in this area \u2013 but again, it comes back to the teaching of digital skills and the acceptance of this new technology. What\u2019s where the hub has a role to play. We were given some funding from Health Education England to bring in technology, to figure out what we needed and do some testing and research.\u202fWith that, we\u2019ve managed to implement quite a lot of these new technologies into our training.\u201d\u00a0\nTraining and upskilling staff to be confident using digital tools\u00a0\nComing back to the training and upskilling of staff to be confident in using digital tools, Liz said that the hub is \u201cstill in the early days\u201d of fitting the technology around its existing training, but the VR training for GP receptionists is a good example of this work in progress.\u00a0\nLiz also mentioned that often with instilling confidence in digital tools and skills, \u201cit\u2019s just the offer of that psychologically safe space to make a mistake\u201d, where staff can practice as much as necessary to get their confidence and capabilities up.\u00a0\nEmma mentioned the disconnect between how confident people tend to be with using technology in their everyday lives, quoting ONS statistics that say that more than 90 percent of people are internet users, and 80 percent of people do their shopping and banking online; but when you look at healthcare, the numbers are comparably small.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got things like the NHS App, which we used beautifully during COVID to get access to vaccine information and so on \u2013 but actually it\u2019s so variable in terms of what GP practices will publish,\u201d she said. \u201cSome patients are more savvy than others, and the same happens with staff. There is a real need to support people who are less confident.\u201d\u00a0\nOX.DH provides sandbox environments, she continued, so that people can test themselves with fictitious patients and get used to the system. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to make it easier for users; so actually, you can\u2019t hit the wrong button if the wrong button isn\u2019t there, and you can\u2019t undertake activities that perhaps your job role doesn\u2019t allow you to do.\u202f\u202fThat role access is a safety net for staff, because then they know they can\u2019t perform actions that would potentially cause problems.\u201d\u00a0\nEmma also highlighted the importance of having champions within a practice, that can help around the training of staff, which she said was something that had been successfully used to support training in OX.DH\u2019s video consultation solution.\u00a0\nThe future of digital in primary care\u202f\u00a0\nAs the panel drew to a close, we asked Emma and Liz what they thought that \u201cgood\u201d looked like in digital primary care, and what they would like to see happen within the next 12 months. Emma shared her supplier perspective, saying:\u00a0\u201cAs an innovator of primary care technology in terms of a foundation solution, I would like to see the new entrants on the tech innovation framework really be supported to be able to provide choice within GP practices. Funding is available to support practices or PCNs to look and explore options with particular suppliers, and there\u2019s additional funding for pre-deployment \u2013 this is \u2018try before you buy\u2019.\u00a0\n\u201cI would like to see more engagement potentially from GPs, just in terms of how we can help, how we can use workflow management to alleviate some of that pressure,\u201d she added, \u201cand also how we can tackle interoperability across the whole of the NHS ecosystem, bringing solutions into one place so you\u2019re not logging onto a number of different systems.\u201d\u00a0\nLiz talked about her overarching goal being the development of a technology-led training and simulation centre, saying that funding was an issue in terms of realising this, but that she would consider doing this in smaller bits if she needed to in order to get that technology into training.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised there is a need for a simulation technician/educator apprenticeship or something similar, and some new support roles for within the hub. So it may be that we\u2019d like to look at how we start that, how we roll that training out.\u201d\u00a0\nShe continued: \u201cThe people that we\u2019ve now got on our preceptorship roles are landing in primary care, and they will be playing a role in helping to realise the role of tech in primary care, because they\u2019ve trained using it.\u201d\u00a0\nRegarding the\u202flong-term workforce plan, Liz noted that she would \u201clike to prove that we could do things differently with a focus on being innovative in the way we deliver stuff \u2013 so we can increase capacity and we can get economies of scale.\u201d\u00a0\nLooking further ahead to the next 10 years, Liz shared that she has been in conversation with NHS England\u2019s blueprinting team, to see whether the hub could look at being a national innovation centre, as well as widening that offer out to community services and social care.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are people working in social care that need the same training that we give our nurses; why is that barrier there? It\u2019s generally down to funding, so it\u2019s about having that integration. There are some integrated academies popping up, and they\u2019re really on the right lines, and I think if we follow that model but with technology, we could have the gold star standard.\u201d\u00a0\nEmma shared that she would like to see an increased focus on streamlining some of the procurement processes and the frameworks, \u201cbecause we\u2019re moving into a new era where suppliers are providing technology that covers more than one element, so it\u2019s not just about workflow or referrals, it\u2019s the whole package\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the tech innovation framework has really opened our eyes on that, and the challenges in terms of enabling the different subject matter experts within the NHS to see that bigger picture. I think there are challenges ahead; the workforce issue is an issue, but if we\u2019re still trying to use old technology then we\u2019re not going to improve. Small incremental steps will lead to bigger and better changes, but we\u2019ve got to start taking those small steps to start with.\u201d\u00a0\nWe\u2019d like to thank Emma and Liz for sharing their insights with us on this topic.\u00a0\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "News in brief: VR app for blood transfusion training, cyber security e-learning, online kidney donor education, and more", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/01/news-in-brief-vr-app-for-blood-transfusion-training-cyber-security-e-learning-online-kidney-donor-education-and-more/", "content": "\nWelcome to our latest news in brief, where we take a look at some of the health tech news to have caught our eye over the last few weeks.\nNHS Blood and Transplant releases VR app for blood matching\nNHS Blood and Transplant has announced the release of a virtual reality training app designed to simulate the process of testing blood for transfusions.\nThe immersive training sees users enter a virtual transfusion lab and meet a patient, with the processing emulating real life as they follow procedure to test the blood group of the sample and select the correct unit of blood.

Nicknamed the \u201csponge on a string\u201d, the test requires patients to swallow a \u201cvitamin-sized capsule containing a small spherical sponge attached to a string\u201d, which expands to collect cells from the lining of the oesophagus prior to being pulled back out.\nThe trust highlights the time-saving benefits of the procedure, which can be completed in around seven-and-a-half-minutes, as well as the reduced invasiveness when compared with traditional endoscopies, which usually require sedation, resulting in a longer hospital stay.\nThe first phase of the programme took place in the endoscopy department at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, and the trust now plans to roll out the service to all patients by the end of 2024, with estimates that it will initially \u201csave around 1,000 appointments\u201d.\nNew website launched in Bradford to encourage more people to become kidney donors\nBradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has launched a new website hoping to encourage more people, and especially those from ethnically diverse communities, to register as a kidney donor.\nHighlighting that \u201cmore than a third of those waiting for a kidney transplant in the city are from ethnically diverse backgrounds\u201d, and wait \u201csignificantly longer for a kidney transplant than white patients\u201d, the trust\u2019s new Live Kidney Donor website includes testimonies from previous donors, as well as information for those who might be considering becoming one.\nThe new website also features a language translation tool, and videos on common questions such as \u201cHow do you feel after?\u201d, along with video content from clinicians offering insight into the advantages of live donor donations for patients.\nIn a recent News in brief article, we looked at news including a new thoracic robotic surgery virtual observership programme at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019, two new UK Approved Bodies for medical device certification, trials for sobriety app and stroke treatment, and more.\nRelatedNews in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026NHS Dumfries and Galloway experiences \"focused and ongoing\"\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024Interview: Doron Dreyer, Cynerio, on the opportunities and\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Research and innovation hub in Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes seeks applications for \u00a315,000 awards for local innovators", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/03/01/research-and-innovation-hub-in-bedfordshire-luton-and-milton-keynes-seeks-applications-for-15000-awards-for-local-innovators/", "content": "\nA research and innovation hub in Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes has issued a call for applications for its research and innovation fund, following a \u00a33 million investment from NHS England, with successful applicants to be awarded up to \u00a315,000 for projects tackling\u00a0an aspect of research or innovation in integrated care provision.\nApplications will be judged against criteria including links to the strategic priorities of the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes ICS, the potential to attract future funding, and \u201cproven expertise of the partners in research or innovation areas\u201d.\nFunding will generally be awarded on a one-year basis, but applications for shorter or longer awards will also be considered on a case-by-case basis, and it is \u201cexpected that applicants will access other sources of funding to complement this award\u201d.\nApplicants will be able to use the funding for research time, evaluation, travel, and \u201ccollaborative activities\u201d such as workshops and engagement.\nProfessor Yannis Pappas, director of the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Research and Innovation Hub, said that the local healthcare system \u201cis a vibrant one for research and innovation, where ideas flourish\u201d and added that the hub \u201cwishes to support service providers to develop their plans for research and innovation by funding up to three programmes\u2026 Proposals can be submitted to address any aspect of research or innovation in integrated care provision, but they should ascertain user needs, address inequalities, and/or build capacity for further research and innovation.\u201d\nAlso on innovation, NHS Supply Chain has announced the launch of its new Medical Technology Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for innovative products, intended to support public sector organisations in accessing goods and services from SMEs who may face barriers when tendering to supply NHS trusts.\nElsewhere, the Department of Health and Social Care has announced the launch of \u00a310 million in funding to be used in part to support eight selected health tech companies in bringing innovative solutions to market, including a device to identify liver cancer tumours;

Then organisations should use a relevant methodology to classify each asset based on the sensitivity of the data it processes or stores, its criticality to the delivery of services, and business criticality and impact.\nFor each asset, NHSE says organisations should identify which resources it communicates with and why; determine which connections to/from medical devices are for clinical data transfers; identify how access can be enabled for remote updates to be delivered if appropriate; determine the connection method used for communication; identify the communications protocol used in that communication; and draw up a network topology map to show how the devices within the scope communicate with associates devices and services.\nThen, the guidance continues, assets should be assigned and segmented into local group based on appropriate organisation-defined criteria \u2013 such as their functionality by department or role, device type, or whether they are part of critical network infrastructure.\nOn the guidance, Doron Dreyer, from health tech supplier Cynerio, a platform for modern healthcare cybersecurity, said to HTN:\u00a0\u201cThis is extremely important work done by the NHS on this important topic. Cynerio is proud to have contributed to these guidelines in the area of medical device security aspect. As we continue to work with the various NHS trusts across the country, we will continue to work with NHS England to find ways to increase cyber resilience.\u201d\nNHSE also shares ten key principles for network segmentation that organisations are encouraged to adopt in this process, including that the most critical assets should be deployed in the most secure network zones; that devices categorised as untrusted should be segmented from the corporate network; and remote access connectivity should be restricted and controlled for medical devices requiring these connections.\nAdditionally, the guidance includes risks and challenges around segmenting the network, such as poor planning, incomplete asset inventory and poor IP address management, with more detail provided here.\nHTN previously covered guidance from the National Cyber Security Centre on how cloud services can be used securely.\nWe also shared updates to the \u2018Keep IT Confidential\u2019 online cyber security awareness toolkit, including two sets of resources for staff working in clinical settings and staff working within the adult social care sector.\nRelatedHywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026NHS Dumfries and Galloway experiences \"focused and ongoing\"\u2026Interview: Doron Dreyer, Cynerio, on the opportunities and\u2026SBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: managing cyber threats, supplier\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Featured interview: Luscii and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust on virtual wards for acute settings", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/29/featured-interview-luscii-and-maidstone-and-tunbridge-wells-nhs-trust-on-virtual-wards-for-acute-settings/", "content": "\nWe recently sat down for a chat on virtual care with Luscii\u2019s managing director, Chris Malone, along with virtual ward matron and hospital avoidance lead Fay Johnstone and ward manager Abigail Scullion from Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells (MTW) NHS Trust. Chris, Fay and Abigail discussed the set-up and implementation of their acute virtual ward, advice on securing clinical buy-in, patient feedback, and more.\nThe vision for the virtual wards\nFay: Our virtual ward is different in the sense that it is an acute virtual ward model. We cover treatments and monitoring and transfer patients in and out of the virtual ward on a step-up, step-down model, depending on their needs. We take patients from the emergency department if appropriate, and then we also look at patients who are already in hospital to see if we could reduce their length-of-stay by bringing them onto the virtual ward.\nThe ward was originally set up off the back of the pandemic to monitor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients by respiratory nurses, but it didn\u2019t have a clinical lead as such. They needed someone with drive in that area. When I came on board, I identified that if we were going to make this work, we needed to involve treatments; we needed to develop it properly into a virtual ward and not just a monitoring service.\nChris: From Luscii\u2019s perspective, our vision first and foremost is to stand together in a partnership. We enable delivery of a digital bridge to facilitate the transfer of information to help the right decisions to be made in the right place at the right time.\nWe always look at the core challenges in some respect \u2013 how do we increase capacity, improve discharge, expand better joined-up healthcare outside of a hospital environment? How can we improve and grow the workforce and help them feel like they\u2019ve got more time to care? These things are always at the back of our mind depending on a clinical team\u2019s requirements. Talking to MTW, it became apparent early in the process that Fay\u2019s vision of taking the service from something fairly standard around monitoring COPD to that acute and A&E focus was quite special, and it very much tied in with those core challenges around increasing capacity and improving discharge.\nSet up and implementation\nChris: The key to a lot of this is to step outside that view of a traditional supplier and provider relationship. If you\u2019re not in the room together and you\u2019re not making decisions together, you\u2019re never going to get to the bottom of the problems and solve them. If clinical teams don\u2019t trust us enough to tell us what is happening on the ground, we can\u2019t help.\nAt Luscii, we are very focused on helping teams conduct digital transformation at scale. We have conducted over 350 remote monitoring pathways in 11 countries. We have incredibly comprehensive implementation plans and stakeholder mapping journeys, we come in and work together with the teams to build and map a care pathways that work for their specific locale and demographics. We don\u2019t believe in throwing the baby out with the bathwater \u2013 we want to augment the great work that is being done internally. It\u2019s a question of how we can help to support that, or supercharge it.\nFay: Exactly as Chris says, from our point of view it\u2019s about trust. One thing that I love about Luscii is that they work with you. It\u2019s not a \u2018them and us\u2019 situation; we go to them if we are stuck on something and they are very quick to respond. They put time and effort into training so you feel valued as one of their programme designers. They are the experts in regards to what other people are doing because they work with other organisations, so we can bounce ideas off them.\nThey have also helped us with getting clinical buy-in, as some clinical teams were a little hesitant to digitise elements of their care pathways and required more support in getting them on board. Chris and the team were very open about coming to engage with the teams, speak their language, share evidence and address their concerns. On that note, something that we have found useful recently is to bring in advanced clinical practitioners to help us get patients onto the virtual wards, because they speak the doctors\u2019 language too. We\u2019ve seen referrals go up, moving 12 new patients onto the virtual wards in two days with our ACPs\u2019 help.\nSecuring clinical buy-in is very personality-based. You need someone very vocal who can drive it. A good way to approach this is to try and get one person on board, to win them over; and then you\u2019ve got someone on your side who can help you talk to their colleagues. We\u2019ve come a long way, so we now have specialties reaching out to us; when they do, I always ask them to give me a lead consultant who is prepared to put their name to it. I want their lead nurses on board, because if they aren\u2019t that can be a major blocker; and I want the general manager to buy into the service too.\nAbigail: With regards to implementing the virtual wards, it comes back to working as a team. We work closely with Cecilia, the implementation specialist at Luscii; she\u2019s always at the other end of the phone, and we have meetings every other week to touch base. If we notice a problem or Cecilia does, this regular contact means it is dealt with before it becomes an issue. It\u2019s all about communication. Also, when we build a programme ourselves on the digital platform, Cecilia will check it for us so there\u2019s a sense of having a failsafe.\nChris: It comes back to having the right people in the room \u2013 clinical, operational, information governance, and everything else that needs to happen behind the scenes. If you want things to run smoothly, they have to be considered and engaged at the same time, from the offset.\nLessons learned\nFay: The main thing I would say, if I was speaking to somebody who was looking to set up this model, would be: don\u2019t base your patient cohort on what is in the community. The community does a lot of work with long term conditions such a heart failure and COPD, but the statistics for COPD alone show that there is an increased risk of a cardiac event, for an acute virtual ward model it is important to recognise this increased risk factor.\nLanguage is also very important. We had to be careful in how we communicated with our clinicians, with regards to the fact that people coming onto the virtual ward aren\u2019t being discharged \u2013 they are being transferred, and if it\u2019s not suitable, they can be transferred back. I think people can get fixated on the terminology used. When we changed our language just slightly, we got a lot more buy-in.\nAbigail: When we started this project, we didn\u2019t have a template from anyone else that we could follow. It\u2019s a very different take on the virtual ward than you tend to see in other trusts. We have been learning as we go along and building an escalation pathway. We\u2019ve had to ensure that everyone knows how to run this \u2018new\u2019 system even when Fay and I, as senior figures, aren\u2019t there; that\u2019s been a lot of hard work, and you really do need to have trust in your team. You also need to trust that your team will tell you when something isn\u2019t right.\nChris:\u00a0Some members of the Luscii team went to visit the staff at the virtual ward to see how they were getting on and it was lovely to see the nurses working in the hub, remotely monitoring patients. We chatted with them and something that struck me was how much the nurses were enjoying the work. They were pleased that it allowed them to be upskilled in different areas of nursing and practice. A lot of the time, if we hear about the NHS workforce it tends to have a negative slant; so it was really nice to hear them talk about how they genuinely enjoy doing that work.\nAbigail: We do hear a lot of comments from our staff about how nice it is to video call the patients and check in on them. When you\u2019re a patient on a ward, it\u2019s very different now to how it used to be, particularly for the older patients when they look back on what they remember. The current pressures mean that it can be difficult for staff to stop and have a chat, but the virtual ward model allows that to happen via our video calls. Because we\u2019ve got the time, the care becomes more holistic in nature \u2013 back to the principles upon which the NHS was started.\nI\u2019d also say there\u2019s a learning around not generalising with age ranges. Our 80+ cohort is actually the most compliant on our virtual ward and we\u2019ve often found that they enjoy using an iPad and remotely chatting with the team.\nMeasuring success\nChris: In terms of statistics, between October 2022 and October 2023, we\u2019ve saved 1,521 respiratory bed days, which has led to cost savings of \u00a3532,000. We have saved 126 general medicine with cost savings of \u00a3441,000, and 174 haematology bed days which saved \u00a3133,000. On top of that, there have been 348 frailty bed days saved, resulting in savings of \u00a3121,000.\u00a0\nFay: We measure success in a few ways with our KPIs around quality improvement and length of stay, monitoring exactly as you would on an inpatient ward and taking into account family feedback, abiding by audits, and so on. Our official reports are on a monthly basis, but for Abigail and myself, we are tracking on a daily basis. As Abigail mentioned, we keep patient safety at the forefront of our mind; we monitor instances and near misses and look into trends and themes, as well as keeping an eye on risk registers and how we are managing those.\nAbigail:\u00a0It\u2019s about the human factor too \u2013 we\u2019ve had some amazing real life feedback from patients, for example telling us that the virtual ward has given them their life back and they\u2019ve been able to spend quality time with their families instead of being long-term inpatients. We recently had a haematology patient who told us he loved it; he could have someone come and take his bloods without leaving his front room. Another patient, the oldest we have had on our virtual ward, was 103; he went home and we were able to give him two weeks of feeling well before he was palliated. It\u2019s not all about everyone going home and living a wonderful life forever, because unfortunately, that\u2019s not going to happen. Some of our patients are really sick. But we can give them that time with their loved ones, and at the end of the day, we are doing this for them. Yes, we cover all our governance and we make sure our KPIs are right, but sometimes stories from patients really remind us of why we are doing this. If they are telling us we are doing it right, then that means something.\nFay:\u00a0We had another young patient with a haematology issue who was really poorly but wanted to self-discharge because he just didn\u2019t want to be on the ward. We went and had a frank conversation with him, and his driver for wanting to leave was that he knew that he was dying and he just wanted to see his two-year-old\u2019s birthday. We offered him care on the virtual ward and he got what he wanted. He had four weeks in our care and two weeks without medical care, and his children and step-children have those memories to keep.\nAbigail:\u00a0It\u2019s the same for our older patients. So often, they just don\u2019t want to stay in hospital. We facilitated an older patient today by getting in touch with her care home and asking if they\u2019ll support us with her if we take her onto her virtual ward.\u00a0They said that if we can get her oxygen and anticipatory meds, then they can care for her \u2013 so she\u2019s going home. She\u2019s 93, and she\u2019s where she wants to be. That\u2019s why we do it.\nChris: I think it comes back to the point Abigail made about the staff on the virtual ward getting the chance to deliver holistic care and get to know patients. Our ethos at Luscii is \u2018space for care\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what we are trying to achieve. This is a really clear example of that.\nPlans for the future\nFay: With our acute virtual ward model, I think the world is our oyster. We can go as far as technology can take us, as long as we keep up that patient safety. The more tech we can bring on board, the more risk we can potentially take.\nI would like to build a reputation for our virtual ward, to continue to build on our clinical engagement, and to expand so we can bring in more patients.\nMy other aim is \u2018joining up the dots\u2019. Abigail and I both have a passion for accident and emergency care, and the staff in those departments are incredibly busy. Emergency care is completely different to general medicine; so why are we using ED for patients requiring medicines and surgeries? Why are we not joining up the dots and working with our community colleagues to bypass ED, so that they can focus on what they are supposed to focus on \u2013 delivering\u00a0 accident and emergency care. If a patient is appropriate for a virtual ward, I want us to be a part of the chain of communication so that they come to us rather than bouncing between GPs and ED.\nChris: At Luscii, our vision is to facilitate this at ICS level, right the way across the system. We want to help join those dots. The flexibility of our platform enables different teams to work in different ways, with the possibility of creating protocols to suit each area. We want to help bridge the gap towards proactive healthcare, so we can put things in place for the next generation who are coming along and will otherwise face the same problems that we are facing now.\nWe are breaking barriers, slowly, but we are getting there. It is a real change and we need to keep thinking like that. Imagine in the future if we could close a ward and really do things differently?\nAbigail:\u00a0I would love to see our work develop into a blueprint for an acute virtual ward that other trusts can follow and replicate, wherever they are. A lot of work has gone into this, and compiling all of our knowledge and experience into one place would be really valuable.\nMany thanks to Fay, Abigail and Chris for joining us and sharing their experiences.\nRelatedInterview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Interview: Doron Dreyer, Cynerio, on the opportunities and\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "University of Leeds researcher develops AI device designed to predict acute kidney injury", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/29/university-of-leeds-researcher-develops-ai-device-designed-to-predict-acute-kidney-injury/", "content": "\nA research team from the University of Leeds has developed an artificial intelligence device said to be capable of predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), following a grant of \u00a3220,000 from Kidney Research UK in partnership with the Stoneygate Trust.\nThe team, led by Dr Sergei Krivov, used historical patient records to develop AKI-Predict with the aim of calculating a patient\u2019s risk of developing AKI and generating an alert to flag these patients to medical staff. The device uses an algorithm based on the current NHS AKI alert system, which utilises indicators such as changes in blood test results to recognise the onset of AKI.\nFollowing the device\u2019s development, the team are to conduct tests across hospitals to ensure that AKI-Predict works for different patients and in real time.\nKidney Research UK states that the development of AKI-Predict could bring potential benefits such as \u201cless severe illness, fewer complications, and shorter hospitalisation\u201d, as well as assisting medical staff and researchers in understanding the factors that can increase or decrease risk of AKI.\nDr Krivov comments: \u201cIt has the potential to significantly improve the care of these patients, help us to better understand the causes of AKI, and identify effective treatments.

Over the last two years, Livi\u2019s work has included developing its clinical services to offer GP or ACP (advanced clinical practitioner) appointments as part of work around improved access and enhanced access contracts, and Livi is now working on \u201cpulling all of our digital offer together\u201d. In terms of her own background, Lyndsey started her career as a dentist and has worked in commissioning in addition to working as head of service at a GP federation.\nIn addition to his role as a digital lead for Greater Manchester Primary Care Provider Board, Chris works at a practice in central Manchester. He described the board as one of the \u201cfirst primary care collaboratives of its kind, bringing together providers in general practice, community pharmacy, optometry and community dentistry\u201d across the region. He is also the clinical lead for Greater Manchester Digital First Primary Care Programme, which focuses on a number of workstreams to promote digital in general practice including supporting digital access, upskilling the workforce and looking into projects such as automation and intelligence-driven primary care. \u201cThere\u2019s a cross-cutting theme of digital inclusion throughout this work,\u201d Chris said, \u201cwhich is a real passion of mine.\u201d\nHow can digital drive patient outcomes?\nPenny raised the implementation of electronic patient records as a key element of this, along with interoperability with the shared care record, which she noted as particularly important in order to link with primary care and other clinical practices.\n\u201cWe are seeing the benefit of electronic prescribing, for example, and how that has reduced errors compared to to writing a drug card where the handwriting might be eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing the benefits of using barcodes to identify patients and give the right medication to the right patients; and benefits around electronic handovers too in terms of getting accurate information at the right time.\u201d\nThese are the standard, day-to-day benefits, Penny noted, but interoperability is a key part of this too. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding what is happening in the community for patients. How can we discharge them to the appropriate place, more quickly? In that sense, we\u2019re seeing interoperability through digital means improving flow through organisations and improving patient outcomes, because we know that longer length-of-stay leads to further de-conditioning.\u201d\nThen there is the aspect of diagnostics, using digital tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand data, make predictions, and support clinical decision-making.\nOn remote care, Penny said: \u201cThis transformed care in the pandemic and beyond. Being able to see patients in their own homes \u2013 and see their carers too \u2013 improves communication which helps decision-making, and this all optimised by digital technology.\u201d\nLyndsey added a point here:\u00a0\u201cIf you look at virtual wards and remote monitoring, there are huge benefits to patients in the sense that they can often really enjoy being able to access care in that way. These kind of digital method can be used in that preventative care space, which feels really positive.\u201d\nChris agreed, and commented that remote monitoring allows clinicians to \u201cwork in partnership with patients\u201d. Additionally, he commented, remote monitoring can be particularly useful in long-term condition monitoring by allowing patients to contribute readings or things like digital questionnaires that can be completed in their own time, rather than struggling to take time off work for appointments or facing similar challenges.\nPenny moved on to raise the importance of patient empowerment and citizen engagement through digital. \u201cThis is extremely important, and we need to offer that agency to patients \u2013 from being able to track their appointments to being able to contact the clinical team, if there is a change in the condition. That\u2019s what proactive care is about.\u201d\nShe concluded by raising a point around use and adoption of digital technologies, stating that getting patients on board with tech and training the staff to use it properly \u201cis a prerequisite to obtaining these benefits\u201d.\nLyndsey agreed: \u201cBeing able to give patients autonomy over their care and being able to enable them to make good choices about their healthcare is really key.\u201d She noted that Livi\u2019s messaging platform\u00a0Mjog has the ability to bulk message patients and send out appointment reminders, which she said \u201cdraws together prevention and access via a digital tool. Also on this note, patients can access our clinical services through many different means \u2013 for example through our app, from partners sending patients to us directly from practice using a digital tool, or through 111. It\u2019s not about creating new digital ways to access care, necessarily, but about dovetailing digital into existing pathways.\u201d\nOn specific patient outcomes, Lyndsey shared that Livi has done a lot of work, especially in European markets, around preventative care, with pathways including\u00a0obesity and asthma care.\nLyndsey also commented on the role of technology given the current workforce challenges in healthcare. \u201cHow do we make sure that we are connecting patients to the clinician that they need to see, in the moment that they need to see them? Using digital platforms means you can connect staff to patients all over the country. This particularly helpful with some population demographics where access may be more challenging, or if you are in rural areas where you are struggling to recruit, for example. It can also provide flexibility for staff and support them in tailoring their work-life balance.\u201d\n\u201cI think one of the main things to consider here is the fact that we have a capacity and demand mismatch in general practice at the moment,\u201d Chris said. \u201cDigital can really help to address that.\u201d\nIt all comes back to getting the right patient to the right person at the right time, he continued, and there are an increasing number of digital tools supporting online consultations, many of which will be on the pathways framework from NHS England. \u201cSome of the triage, AI and large language models within that really help identify who needs seeing now, who can wait a couple of days, who can be signposted. This helps us to make the most of the workforce we have.\u201d\nChris also mentioned the NHS App, saying that it could be a \u201creal positive\u201d for general practice. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of opportunity for it to be used better, and I\u2019d like to really encourage people to turn on things like push messaging within the NHS App, because that is a really potent way of conversing with patients.\u201d As well as allowing access, supporting prescriptions and potentially reducing medication waste, Chris emphasised that the app \u201ccreates a sense of agency for patients\u201d and encourages them to take ownership of their care.\nHe also noted the \u201cnumerous examples of decision support tools which integrate into GP records\u201d, highlighting one tool he uses for acute cancer care which \u201cpops up when I am consulting to remind me to think about potentially missed opportunities to make early diagnoses. I think that\u2019s a very strong way to drive patient outcomes.\u201d\nHow can we accelerate patient benefits and outcomes?\nLyndsey pointed out that the pandemic necessitated a change in healthcare delivery which included fast deployment of tools that would potentially have taken a long time to adopt in other circumstances. \u201cIt demonstrates that the NHS is able to move at pace,\u201d she said.\nThe General Practice Forward View from April 2016 included \u201cfive years of funding, some of which was dedicated to digital \u2013 that gave practice, partners and providers time to test out tools, to figure out how to use them, to work out how the tools could be meaningful to them in their everyday practice. I think having longer term funding streams like this helps people embed digital, so it doesn\u2019t just become an add-on, it becomes integrated into the everyday.\u201d\nLooking at how some of those integration challenges is key, Lyndsey suggested, along with exploring how this can be done at scale. \u201cThen you get all the benefits of resilience and economy too.\u201d\nPenny said: \u201cWe need to set a vision for digital-first as an approach; that digital is be part of the whole enablement to continuously improve in healthcare. Digital should be part of our innovation plans.\u201d\nEngagement is also important, Penny added, including engaging with all stakeholders from clinicians to data analysts. \u201cWe need to look at how we are using data in our everyday practice to understand common problems and how to solve them, as well as how technology could help us do this.\u201d\nThat includes patient involvement, Penny continued. \u201cOften, we try to feed technologies into pathways, but they are not actually serving a purpose or they do not add value to the patient pathway. We need to better understand how we incorporate technologies and use design thinking with patients to understand how tech can actually make pathways better, make the service itself better, and improve patient outcomes.\u201d\nChris reflected that the NHS can sometimes have a tendency to impose how people access their care. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are always all that good with patient involvement,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut the way to get digital tools embedded and adopted is to make them a great experience to use. People use things that work well. If they have a bad experience, why would they use it rather than reverting back to what they did before? I think it\u2019s really key that we work with patients to make digital tools something that they would choose, rather than feeling that the tools are imposed upon them.\u201d\nHe also raised the need to further train the healthcare workforce in foundational digital skills. \u201cWe don\u2019t train people to use Microsoft Office, for example \u2013 we make an assumption that people know how to do it, but not everyone does. We state on job descriptions that people need to be competent in these tools, but do we ever support them to make sure that they are doing it right? It comes back to the workforce having confidence in the tools that they use.\u201d\nIn Manchester, Chris shared, there is a push to get the primary care workforce to use the NHS App for themselves. \u201cWhat better form of agency to get people to use the app than a personal recommendation from a real person who can properly share their experience?\u201d\nHowever, digital exclusion must be considered. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take an inclusive approach, we will end up double running systems. I often hear that the argument for digital is: if we can get 80 percent of people to use it, then we have more time to deal with the 20 percent who can\u2019t use the digital tools or may struggle with them. I don\u2019t think we are anywhere near the 80/20 split in reality, and we need to do a lot in healthcare to really support people to address digital inclusion, which covers skills, confidence, connectivity and access.\u201d\nHow can digital support self-help, engagement and activation?\u00a0\nOn how the healthcare system can reach that 80/20 objective, Chris said: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge, but I think it\u2019s important to step back and realise what the benefit of digital is to people. In my clinic, I\u2019ve realised that I am seeing more people struggling with problems in life, poor housing, poverty, isolation and so on; and some of those things can be positively affected by getting online. For example, evidence suggests that manual workers who are online\u00a0will earn more in a year than they would if they were not on the internet. There are everyday examples too \u2013 I recently had my car MOT and I got a 10 percent discount for booking it online, that\u2019s a saving made because I use digital tools.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the case of digital improving isolation by helping to connect people to their friends and family, or helping them make new connections. In that sense, digital can be shown to improve people\u2019s health just by being able to access tools. This helps when making a case for why healthcare providers should promote digital inclusion. It becomes fundamental for delivering proactive, preventative care.\u201d\nPenny raised the point that one size does not fit all, with a need to cater both for patients who are happy to access information and results online to take care of their health where they can, and those who require clinical support in order to do that.\n\u201cIn terms of driving outcomes, I agree with Chris\u2019s points. I think we have an opportunity with digital tech to educate patients; for example, what do your vital signs actually mean? How do you know that your diabetes is improving? What are you looking for and what do changes mean for you? If your blood pressure drops, does that mean you are feeling better, that you are spending more time doing the things you enjoy? It\u2019s an opportunity to use nudge theory within digital; patients, when they see that they are gaining these real-life improvements, are often more likely to persevere and do more about it. Eventually, bad habits can turn into good habits.\n\u201cI think we have an opportunity as clinicians to co-design tools with patients to make them clear, simple and to make the most of other opportunities \u2013 for example, make them connectable to the wearables that a lot of people own nowadays, so we can use that data if it is there. This helps drive people to become accountable for their health. That then leads to bigger things \u2013 if we look after ourselves and our families, then the population gets healthier, and there is less disease and less burden.\u201d\nLyndsey agreed that demonstrating value is key, at patient level but also at system level. Are digital tools helping to reduce unplanned care admissions, are they helping to relieve the burden on PCNs? \u201cThere is also the cost opportunity \u2013 if you are working on extending your access, opening longer hours at a physical site, your costs are going to increase in various ways, and that has a huge impact on systems. But if you are taking away facility costs and stock costs by implementing a digital tool, then that is a key benefit you can demonstrate at system level.\u201d\nAlleviating capacity and demand challenges\nChris posed a question: do we actually know what demand is in general practice? Before advanced telephony and online consultation routes, practices surmised that demand was whatever the capacity of a phone queue was.\n\u201cIn order to manage demand and assign appropriate capacity to deal with it, we need to know what demand is. Some of the tools we have in advanced telephony for example include the ability to look into failure demand; how many people called back next day because they didn\u2019t get through? How many people are signposted away because we have given them opportunities to self-manage?\u201d Until we know the answer to these questions, Chris said, general practice cannot truly manage capacity.\nWith the various access routes now in place, he continued, there is a need to bring data together to form meaningful insights. \u201cThen we can better match workforce to demand,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere demand hits is not consistent over the course of a week. We need to look into every aspect and then plan around that.\u201d\nChris also mentioned that some of the triage and digital pathway tools \u201creally do help manage capacity and demand, in active signposting, supportive self-help, and prioritising people who need to be seen sooner. It\u2019s about working with patients to work with demand, and find the right capacity for the right people.\u201d\nThe acute system, Lyndsey pointed out, has things like OPAL scores so clinicians know when there are challenges in the system; but primary care does not have this transparency in the same way. \u201cAt Livi we have been trying to design services whereby we can increase or decrease support depending on factors such as resilience position of the practice,\u201d she shared. \u201cWe have services where it is an add-on, where a certain number of hours are there to be delivered as needed; or you can dial up that service when you need to. It would be amazing to do that at scale, because there is the scope to do that beyond the boundaries of a PCN.\u201d\nLyndsey also noted the role of data. \u201cIn some of our practices where we can see a broader dataset, we can see when patients try to use the app, when they complete a symptom form, when they attempt to book an appointment, or whether they have attempted multiple times. We can then use all of those factors to design workforce around this.\u201d\n\u201cHow we can alleviate demand is an important question to ask,\u201d Penny reflected, \u201cand it encompasses emergency demand versus elective demand as well. A couple of years ago, we looked at some data from our organisation and we could see that a third of people coming into A&E didn\u2019t need to, there were other services they could use such as primary care or social care. With that in mind, I think implementing tools that can direct patients to the appropriate service is really important. That requires consistency, having the appropriate tools there for patients to use, and having the other services in place.\u201d\nThe other aspect is the management of elective demand, Penny continued. \u201cIt comes back to the opportunity to prioritise \u2013 how we can use tech to identify people with the highest risk of deterioration due to comorbidities. We also need to look at sociodemographic elements and social determinants of health. We\u2019ve done some work in this area, looking at our waiting list and prioritising people in terms of the impact that waiting is likely to have on things like their job, the role they play in society.\u201d\nPenny also noted the benefits of virtual wards in keeping people out of hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s about having the right criteria, selecting the right patients who can use the tools at home and having that safe pathway set up for them,\u201d she said.\nLearnings from outside the UK\n\u201cSome of the work that Livi has been doing in Europe has been really interesting, combining digital with physical,\u201d Lyndsey said.\nLivi has undertaken this work in Sweden and France, with Lyndsey sharing a particular example from Sweden. In this project, when patients register with the service \u2013 particularly if they have multiple conditions \u2013 Lyndsey said that they see \u201ca peak of access in the first three months, and then it goes down. Whether the contacts they have with us are digital or physical, the number reduces after that period, because they\u2019ve been able to access the care that they needed, as they needed it. That speaks volumes to me. I think often it\u2019s a struggle to get data in the UK around the onward journey of patients because of the challenges around accessing data and integrating it with systems, so this project raises an interesting picture.\u201d\nLyndsey also highlighted an obesity programme run in Sweden which takes a virtual multi-disciplinary approach, and described how Livi has utilised a virtual workforce for other areas of care such as women\u2019s health. \u201cMenopausal care is not addressed at primary care level, so we have brought in nurses and midwives specifically around women\u2019s health to support more women to get access to the care they need. We also have sexual health clinics as well.\u201d\nChallenges to be tackled\u00a0\nConcluding the main part of our webinar, we asked our panellists for their views on the main challenges that need to be tackled in this area.\nPenny highlighted change fatigue. \u201cThere are a lot of pilots and innovations coming in and out, which is great and exciting, but it\u2019s important that we look after our staff and workforce because there can often be a lot of things happening at the same time as day-to-day work. We need to always come back to looking at what the problem is that we are trying to solve and how we can own it together and use technology to solve it, avoiding burnout.\u201d She also raised education and digital literacy, for patients as well as staff.\nChris agreed. \u201cI think the biggest challenge we need to tackle is digital exclusion. The health service is supposed to provide care for everyone and we need to be really cognizant of that. There are various ways to address it; it just takes a concerted universal approach.\u201d He recommended that anyone interested in going further with this challenge could look into AbilityNet or The Good Things Foundation\u2019s National Digital Inclusion Network.\nLyndsey picked up on the point around consistency. \u201cThere are lots of one-off pieces of funding around specific challenges, but that often means that you have a service for a while, patients get used to it, and then it\u2019s gone. If you have services that are integrated and very much part of your experience, and it\u2019s just what patients expect, then it is easier for them to learn how to access it.\u201d Additionally, Lyndsey suggested that more needs to be done around linking in with other third-sector providers.\nMany thanks to our panellists for joining us.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026SBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "North East and North Cumbria ICS pledges to adopt analytics-driven approach in draft innovation strategy", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/28/north-east-and-north-cumbria-ics-pledges-to-adopt-analytics-driven-approach-in-draft-innovation-strategy/", "content": "\nNorth East and North Cumbria ICS has published a draft research and innovation strategy which sets out seven principles including a focus on collaboration across the region to capitalise on assets, infrastructure and relationships \u201cto unlock new technologies, accelerate clinical trials and develop new methodologies to meet the health and care needs of our population\u201d.\nAnother of the seven principles places the focus on data, with the ICS pledging to support the use of evidence and analytics \u201cto understand if we are doing things the right way\u201d.

She joined Airedale two years ago as digital care hub manager to set up the COPD service.\n\u201cThe digital care hub was started in 2011, but prior to that we\u2019d implemented a prison service to stop prisoners having to come out for their outpatients appointments,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cIt was helping increase capacity within the prison service, reduce costs, and increase the capacity of prisoners that were able to attend appointments, because they\u2019re unable to attend if there aren\u2019t prison guards to take them.\u201d\nA couple of years after the hub launched, Rachel described how digital technologies such as cameras and laptops were placed into care homes to help support patients with clinical consultations.\n\u201cWe do that across the whole of England and Wales \u2013 we\u2019ve got 750 care homes,\u201d she shared. \u201cThat allows us to do one-to-one consultations, prescribe for them if required, or refer them onto an appropriate service, reducing hospital admissions and unnecessary pressure on primary care.\u201d\nIn 2014, Goldline was introduced, an initiative for patients on the gold standards framework in the last year of life.\n\u201cWe have 3000 patients across our local area on this caseload, and we support them with everything and anything that they need, referring them onto the district nurses or doctors if they need to be seen, and just being there for patients who are at the worst time of their lives,\u201d said Rachel.\nMoving onto the development of the COPD service, Rachel explained that from the time that she joined the hub, an umbrella called MyCare 24 was introduced, with a number of services beneath it. Starting with a Parkinson\u2019s caseload, the service grew with COVID virtual wards during the pandemic, which linked into the\u00a0 rapid scaling of the COPD service.\n\u201cWe were given some funds by NHS England to pilot the COPD service. There are just short of 14,000 patients in Bradford District and Craven that have COPD, and there were 8,366 patients at the time of starting this service that had moderate, severe, or very severe COPD. There were an awful lot of ambulance conveyances, and we were inundated at both hospitals with respiratory problems which were mainly COPD. In parts of our region, average life expectancy for a male with COPD drops by 20 years, due to deprivation and lifestyle factors; so there was something to be done about bridging that gap and focusing on we could create care for all equally, improve the quality of health, and reduce the risk factors on local services.\u201d\nImplementing Luscii\nRachel shared more around the implementation of Luscii, how this worked within the COPD service and some of the benefits being seen to date.\n\u201cWe are not a virtual ward; we are a service at scale,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started the pilot with 50, and we now have 7,000 patients sent to us by GP practices. We decided to join forces with Luscii, who we\u2019d used during COVID \u2013 we really liked everything about the service, it\u2019s wonderful for patients because it\u2019s very patient friendly and helps them to see their own trajectory of care.\u201d\nThe main focus was reducing hospital admissions, she continued; but the team was aware that there is \u201cnot always a massive amount of information on COPD for patients when they are first diagnosed\u201d. She pointed out that patients are often picked up once they have had one or two acute admissions, which could have been reduced at the time if the patient had received the right education about lifestyle, medication management and to use an inhaler properly.\n\u201cThose things are really important with this cohort of patients, and we didn\u2019t feel that having them on for a short period of time and then sending them off again was really going to have the educational effect that we wanted on them,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cWe wanted them to feel like they did have 24/7 support. Unlike some virtual wards, we are a 24/7 service; so if they wake up in the middle of the night and they don\u2019t feel well, they can call us and have somebody there on the end of the phone, rather than calling in a paramedic or leaving it until the morning and having deteriorating symptoms, and then ending up in hospital.\u201d\nIn terms of benefits at scale, Rachel noted that when the service was set up it was estimated to cost\u00a0\u00a373 per patient, per year, based on a caseload of 6,000 patients. \u201cWe wanted to reduce unscheduled activity by 30 percent, which was around a \u00a31.15 million cost benefit,\u201d she shared.\n\u201cIn terms of challenges, setting up any virtual ward is a challenge; it\u2019s a very different way of thinking across the board. People fear that they might to lose their jobs, they fear that they won\u2019t have control. A lot of people feel like care within their own home is still quite a risky place to be.\n\u201cI think we found those things a challenge, but not as much of a challenge as other things like the onboarding of patients \u2013 that was possibly our biggest challenge. I don\u2019t think we fully expected the GPs to take it up as much as they did; when you\u2019ve got 6,000 patients who all want onboarding very quickly, and you\u2019ve got a limited amount of onboarders because of the way the funding was given, that can become a challenge.\u201d\nOne of the ways in which the team overcame that challenge was to \u201cjoin forces again with Luscii,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cand join forces with the company that was already within the trust called DrDoctor. They send out outpatient letters, which is brilliant and reduced our non-attendances. Luscii helped us set up a link that went through DrDoctor, so that patients could onboard themselves onto the Luscii platform, which massively reduced the length of time we spent on onboarding.\n\u201cStaffing is obviously an issue; we had challenges within the hub, especially since this started when we were still going through COVID. I think when we look back, we probably needed to look at the staffing model a little bit differently. I think if you were going to set this up at scale, I\u2019d encourage people to really look into the staffing side \u2013 because it\u2019s definitely a challenge with that amount of patients.\u201d\nFunding is also an issue, Rachel added, as is digital exclusion. \u201cWithin our local area, there\u2019s an awful lot of deprivation, and that can mean patients that don\u2019t have mobile phones that are able to put the app on, data challenges, some of the population not wanting to use a digital app or not knowing how.\u201d\nHowever, she noted that COVID \u201cdefinitely helped change things with digital \u2013 I think it definitely allowed people to be more open to using apps.\u201d\nService impact\nMoving on to discuss the service impact, Rachel shared that the trust is working with Health Innovation Manchester under NHS England to perform a review.\n\u201cWe average around 1,000 clinical calls a month, and 1,000 Luscii alerts \u2013 they can be red or amber alerts and they\u2019re based on the NEWS2 scoring,\u201d she shared. \u201cIf a patient is an amber alert, they will get a message to say that we\u2019ve seen the alert and we\u2019re aware, and if you need us to give us a call. If it\u2019s a red alert, they\u2019ll get message as well to say we\u2019ll call you back within five minutes.\n\u201cOur response time is absolutely outstanding, patients feel secure and supported, and that\u2019s making a big difference to their quality of life.\u201d\nAcross the whole cohort since the started, there have been around 20,000 clinical calls. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a 1.1 percent ambulance conveyance rate; for 6,000 patients and 1,000 clinical calls a month, that\u2019s very low,\u201d she continued.\nNon-elective admissions have been reduced by 50 percent; A&E attendances by 21 percent; and there is a 7.83 percent referral rate to the GPs. 98.9 percent of patients remain within their own home.\nThe service links in with SystmOne, which Rachel said helps the team have \u201ca full view of patients\u2019 care. That really helps, because when they come in to us, we\u2019re not asking lots of questions about past medical history; we can see all current medication, and we can start supporting them.\u201d\nA main aim of the service was to reduce the use of medication. If patients are not using current medications like inhalers properly, this can be seen on SystmOne. \u201cWe can refer them into places like pulmonary rehab and the hospice where they do better breathing groups, and refer them to exercise classes, smoking cessation classes, anything to try and improve their quality of life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf we pick up a patient who might be struggling at home, we can refer into services that might provide food parcels, blankets, heaters, change the light bulbs, help with the boilers. We really do link-in with community services; we look at these patients in a holistic viewpoint as well. Patients receive person-centred care.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cAlthough our service is digitally enabled, we realise that our patients may not be. As such, we do have a paper diary for patients which means they can follow their own trajectory of care and can call us 24/7 even if they don\u2019t have Luscii.\u201d\nKey learnings and next steps\nOn key learnings and takeaways from the project to date, Rachel offered some of her insights, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep patients active. They will use us a lot at the time of an exacerbation, they\u2019ll use us quite a lot the first few months; then generally they\u2019ll drop off a little bit. It\u2019s been really important to keep those patients engaged, to make sure that they\u2019re still managing their medications OK, that they\u2019re getting the correct education and are looking after themselves, especially over the winter months.\n\u201cWe will send messages out to make sure that they\u2019re keeping up to date with vaccinations, that they\u2019re keeping well. It\u2019s really important to keep that engagement going \u2013 because we don\u2019t want to be just used within a crisis, we want them to use us all the time. \u201d\nIn addition, Rachel said, it\u2019s important to share why we\u2019re digitally safe and engaging people to trust in digital.\n\u201cI think our results speak for themselves, and I think people are slowly starting to learn that and understand that we can look after these patients without seeing them face-to-face, and keep them well in their own home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to underestimate the time it takes to digitally engage patients. You\u2019ve got to build that rapport, build that understanding, educate them on how to use the app, how to use a pulse oximeter, and how they can manage that level of care at home.\u201d\nFinally, Rachel presented the service\u2019s next steps, and plans for the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently going through business finance and systems to have this forever, which would be my hope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long process; finances are very short and there are lots of services to fund, so despite having outstanding results, we still have to fight for our place within the business cases.\n\u201cWe want to sustain all that meaningful engagement, so we\u2019re doing a lot of engagement with our patients \u2013 follow-ups, three-monthly messages to remind them we\u2019re here, what\u2019s going on. The plan is to go back through all the patients that didn\u2019t want the app at the time, and see if anything\u2019s changed, if we can support them with that onboarding now.\u201d\nAnother goal is to work with companies to get free digital support; Rachel shared that local supermarkets have supplied some mobile phones to patients which allows them to access the app. \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure that we\u2019re fully reaching our whole cohort, avoiding those recurrent admissions,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe definitely want to work more closely with Luscii \u2013 we\u2019ve got some video calling going on now, so we are sorting out some iPads as well as additional languages on the app, and doing some more data driven activity as well.\u201d\nUltimately, the trust aims to expand the service to offer a service at scale for heart failure, dependent upon commissioner support.\nThe supplier perspective\nAfter Rachel\u2019s presentation, Luscii\u2019s Ruben shared with us his insight from a supplier perspective.\n\u201cLuscii was born in 2018, in the Netherlands, and we made our way into the UK in 2019,\u201d he shared. \u201cOur mission is to create space for care, which comes down to saving time, doing things more efficiently, or using Luscii as a filter for flagging those patients who need the attention most, instead of having to monitor them one-by-one.\n\u201cWhat is striking in Airedale is that Luscii is being used to amplify the capacity to look after patients by using it as a filter. But that is only going to help you so far if you have a small team, because in the end, capacity will still have its limits. By setting up a hub that is not there just for Luscii, but also for multiple services, there is the capacity to look after way more patients. You can go all the way up to 6,000 patients, and still be able to manage that with a relatively small team. I think that\u2019s the beauty of setting it up the way Rachel and her team have done at Airedale.\u201d\nOn how the service could be expanded across an IBS,\u00a0Ruben said: \u201cIf you want to expand throughout the region, setting up infrastructure like a hub is one of those things to do. That makes the way you care for patients applicable not just for one department, one hospital, one trust; but for the whole of the region, from a technical point of view with infrastructure and such.\n\u201cI think the other one is building on each other\u2019s work, working together between trusts within the ICS, learning from each other. At Luscii we also facilitate people to share what they have done, and let other people apply it to their local context by configuring it without having to build it all from scratch. So if there\u2019s already experience within the ICS with digital hubs, virtual wards, remote monitoring, it makes it easier if you just connect to each other and join those dots.\u201d\nContinuing on to discuss how the service could be expanded to other areas, Ruben commented that it may be difficult for organisations to foresee themselves running a service like this because of the scale, \u201cbut you start small and you dream big.\u00a0That means that any of the experiences that you have with maybe 50 patients will help you discover what you need in order to do it at scale. Protocols are important, and if you have the right protocols in place that tell your staff what to do in certain situations or in decision-making, it makes it much easier to do these things from a centralised perspective.\u201d\nRuben also talked about critical enablers for working at scale, sharing: \u201cIt\u2019s important to have the mindset that will allow you to try something new, learn from it, and then try it at a bigger scale. This system has been used in over 350 care hubs in the Netherlands and the UK, and the patient safety element is covered through the design of the system. The thing that you need to get used to is the fact that you have a virtual team member that is monitoring your patients. Building trust in the technology, and in that it can actually make your life easier, I think that can be a difficult thing to learn.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to thank Rachel and Ruben for sharing their work and experience with us.\nRelatedInterview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026Birmingham and Solihull ICS strategy highlights central role\u2026University Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust announces EPR\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Norfolk and Waveney ICS plans new repeat prescription service for digitally excluded patients", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/27/norfolk-and-waveney-ics-plans-new-repeat-prescription-service-for-digitally-excluded-patients/", "content": "\nNorfolk and Waveney ICS has announced plans to develop a new service to support digitally excluded patients across the system with their repeat prescription requests, following a survey launched in October 2023 on the current service, which garnered over 2,700 responses and highlighted key themes including the impact on people who are not comfortable with digital tools or do not have access to them, and the need to ensure that any future service is available equitably across the footprint.\nThe existing service, prescription ordering direct (POD), allows patients to order their repeat prescriptions over the phone or online.

Matthew, Ramandeep and Dan discussed how digital workforce systems can be utilised to achieve\u00a0long-term outcomes, covering procurement all the way through to change management, adoption, and outcomes.\nIntroducing our panellists\nWith each of our panellists sharing an introduction to themselves and their background, Matthew highlighted how, prior to his current role as digital lead at Northamptonshire ICS, he spent 20 years mainly working in communications for central government, as well as working for hospital trusts in Northamptonshire and a mental health charity, delivering a range of projects and programmes.\n\u201cNow, my main focus is the shared care record across our system, the data behind all that, and how we use that for all sorts of purposes relating to population, health, and health inequalities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from managing single big projects, to managing a lot of wide-ranging projects with lots of different stakeholders.\u201d\nDaniel shared how he came to be working in his current role with Patchwork Health, which he describes as an \u201cend-to-end workforce management solution covering everything from junior doctor rota compliance to agency supply chains\u201d. He noted that he brought around 15 years of lived experience of NHS workforce management to the role, having managed a number of NHS workforce improvement projects at department, trust, and ICS level. \u201cI\u2019ve got a real passion for improving the workforce space, so it made perfect sense to transition across to the supplier side, so I could continue to use that experience an effective way,\u201d he explained.\nPrior to taking on her current role as CCIO at University Hospitals of Northamptonshire, Ramandeep worked as a pharmacist, and shared that she brings that perspective to her work in supporting digital transformation across Northamptonshire.\nStarting with procurement\nKicking off the discussion, the panellists discussed finding the right platform and their priorities in terms of the procurement process.\nMatthew highlighted the importance of putting stakeholders first, across clinical, operational, and HR. \u201cThat\u2019s where the real requirements are, and it\u2019s having a flexible conversation at that point. I always use the MoSCoW method: must have, should have, could have, and won\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helps bring people to a decision about the requirements.\u201d\nThe next stage, he said, covers the digital technology assessment criteria that your organisation has. \u201cThat\u2019s really important from an NHS perspective, that you have a process of assessment behind all of your technical purchases.\u201d\nMatthew also noted the need to ensure that solutions are interoperable, because \u201cfor workforce systems this is a big issue at the moment, because we have a number of people working agency or bank across different organisations, and the more congruent we can be with the way we develop our systems together, then the better chance our workforce has of working more harmoniously across the system\u201d.\nDaniel added his thoughts from a supplier perspective, stating that most often the two factors looked at most closely during procurement are features and price, which can mean sometimes losing sight of the value that could potentially be offered by a solution.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point just putting tech in for tech\u2019s sake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking at what the problems are that we\u2019re trying to solve \u2013 will this solution allow us to get there? I also think it\u2019s important to look at how innovative a provider has been, and what other factors are in the running. Do you need to employ huge teams of experts, which would be costly; and on the social side, are people going to use it? At tender some of these other questions aren\u2019t necessarily being asked, or being given the same priority in that process.\u201d\nChange management\nWe moved on to discuss change management, and what good change management should look like, asking our panellists for their insights and perspectives on this topic.\nMatthew talked about how health is \u201cvery different to other industries\u201d in terms of risk appetite, due to the need to consider the clinical safety element.\n\u201cIn Northamptonshire, both Ramandeep and I are very much \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 type leaders,\u201d he reflected. \u201cRamandeep covered both hospitals with digital workshop days, which included the whole hospital, and there\u2019s constant moving around the hospital to meet teams. It\u2019s about ensuring that change is happening appropriately, and appointing change champions in different areas.\u201d\nAt an ICS level, Matthew noted that he recently visited 33 GP surgeries on one day, to deliver materials and talk to practice managers. \u201cI\u2019m very aware that change management within healthcare requires boots on the ground, and all the training and stuff you can deliver doesn\u2019t replace that face to face interaction,\u201d he said.\nRamandeep agreed with Matthew on the importance of being active in getting everyone involved in the change management process and thinking about standardisation.\n\u201cGoing from paper to digital is not just about replacing paper for the sake of it; you need to think about how you really transform that process,\u201d she stated. \u201cHaving different teams involved in that early engagement \u2013 everyone who is going to use the system, right the way from finance colleagues to your corporate team and communications team \u2013 gives you a really good foundation.\u201d\nDan also emphasised the benefits of identifying stakeholders early on in the process, adding that there needs to be empathy around what people may be dealing with in terms of change fatigue, and that this should be factored in when implementing technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see where that can be implemented to support another programme of work, or to be aligned as an enabler of achieving that outcome as well, in order to minimise the amount of changes happening. It\u2019s being able to take people on that journey, and making sure what you are implementing is not an extra burden, but will add some value to to them and their patients.\u201d\nStakeholder engagement\nRamandeep offered us some insight into her experiences around stakeholder engagement, including from running three-monthly digital roadshows to help engage with teams from around the trust.\n\u201cThere are lots of different communication channels, and it\u2019s not just about sending out an e-mail in the hopes that people will read it. We\u2019ve designed these roadshows that are open to anyone in the hospital to come and attend, and we\u2019ve got all of our six digital teams there. Merchandise never goes amiss, so definitely reach out to suppliers to get some freebies! The other concept that we\u2019ve also introduced is digital responders, who actually go out there and ask people whether they have any digital issues, to find out how we can help. Digital is important for everyone in the organisation, and I think if you can carry that ethos through, then that really helps with that communication and stakeholder engagement.\u201d\nTraining and adoption\nHow can you train large numbers of staff on clinical software, with figures in the hundreds and often thousands?\nRamandeep suggested looking at this in two parts. \u201cIt\u2019s about having that robust digital training team, firstly in your own space, because I think they are an absolute asset to all of our organisations. Then it\u2019s about thinking on a wider scale, to the people requiring training.\u201d\nShe commented that a hybrid approach is \u201cdefinitely something that is really essential. If we say that everyone needs to go out and complete an e-learning package, that may not be suitable for everyone. People have different learning needs and different learning styles, and we need to be able to give people a different option for training.\u201d She suggested asking sites that have already gone live how they achieved it and utilising user guides to support in this area, as well as making training available in bite-sized chunks.\nYou also have to be clear on what your target is and stick to it, she pointed out; how many people need to be trained before you are going live? This can be difficult with how busy staff teams are, Ramandeep acknowledged, noting that she has seen some areas incentivise training in order to support uptake.\n\u201cIt goes back to stakeholder engagement and the change management process \u2013 it all ties into one in terms of getting people trained, and getting people to understand why they need to be trained.\u201d\nDaniel agreed with the need to break training down into bite-sized chunks, stating that that was the methodology in place at Patchwork, and that this made it much easier than trying to learn an entire new system, which would be \u201coverwhelming\u201d.\nHe also spoke of Patchwork\u2019s approach to training \u201cchampions\u201d, saying: \u201cAs a supplier, it\u2019s not possible to train 100 percent of people. But what we can do is train and deploy champions, who can act as ongoing support for the organisation. We try to embed that into the system as well The way I describe it is: we\u2019ve all logged into Facebook at some point and made a post, and we haven\u2019t needed someone from Facebook to come and show us how to do that, it\u2019s just clear through effective product design. If we can\u2019t put a system in front of a user and them be able to work it out, then we\u2019ve not done our job properly. End users can always come through to us for support, if needed, too.\u201d\nDaniel also shared how Patchwork uses questions coming in from end users to improve products, and focus in on things that might need changing.\nMatthew highlighted the need for ongoing training, since if an organisation is running a month-long training programme, those who completed it in the first week \u201care going to have forgotten by the time you go live\u201d.\n\u201cThe key is data,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just data around training, but actually about the use of the system and whether you are getting adoption right. For example, I sat in a control room in the mental health charity I worked in and watched people enter their rosters every day for six weeks, to make sure that things were being done right. Projects aren\u2019t over when they go live, you need to focus on ensuring that adoption and the way people have been trained is effective.\u201d\nMeasuring success\nDaniel discussed how Patchwork currently measures success, highlighting the\u00a0collection of as much baseline data as possible, including qualitative feedback from users. He also noted the importance of deciding collectively with partners what \u201cgood\u201d looks like and benchmarking success early on, to enable outcomes to be measured against these at a later date.\n\u201cEarly in my career, we didn\u2019t set any of that benchmarking,\u201d he reflected. \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring actual requirements into consideration \u2013 often they are around effective clinical delivery in the case of workforce projects, looking at costs related to temporary staffing, time-releasing benefits, and so on. It\u2019s not just about putting that bit of technology in, there\u2019s ongoing touch points throughout, and we always check those with our partners.\u201d\nRamandeep raised the importance of quantitative measures too, using the example of EPR implementation. In particular, she noted how it would be necessary to measure factors such as reduction in number of incidents reported and changes in service desk ticket numbers.\n\u201cWinning the hearts and minds of people, and getting that culture change in place, is really important from an adoption perspective,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also key to ensure accountability for benefits realisations; so if you said at the outset that a certain benchmark was going to be achieved, is there someone who is accountable for ensuring that that benefit is realised?\u201d\nMatthew shared that one of the things he had observed was how \u201cwe haven\u2019t got smart about the data that we\u2019ve got in our systems\u201d.\nHe explained: \u201cThe more we can learn about how we can use data effectively and track outcomes, the more we can look at things like the service received, whether people are engaged and happy at work, and so on. We have to learn how to do things differently, still treating people with dignity and respect, and still focusing on the safety and quality of what we do.\u201d\nUsing an example from Northamptonshire, Matthew shared how a digital academy has been set up which supports data skills across all organisations, including councils, GPs, hospitals, mental health and community. This has been essential to building pathways and \u201csystems of the future\u201d, he said, as it enables more intelligent use of data with better outcomes. Matthew previously joined HTN to discuss this project in more detail here.\nThe panel discussion can be viewed in full below, and more information on Patchwork Health can be found here.\nWe\u2019d like to thank all of our panellists for taking the time to share with us their thoughts and insights on this topic.\n\u00a0\n\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Scottish dementia strategy highlights role of digital and data in creating \u201cresilient communities\u201d, educating carers, and promoting inclusion", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/22/scottish-dementia-strategy-highlights-role-of-digital-and-data-in-creating-resilient-communities-educating-carers-and-promoting-inclusion/", "content": "\nThe Social Care and National Care Service Development Directorate within the Scottish Government has published its dementia strategy 2024-2026, outlining how the government commits to working \u201cwith the voices of lived experience\u201d to achieve its vision for change in dementia care and highlighting digital as one of the key thematic priorities.\nActions to be taken include working to ensure that dementia is part of the discussion in the Scottish Government\u2019s Digital Health and Care Strategy and supporting the development of digital innovation through commissioning and funding related programmes including around information provision and workforce development, with the latter including a focus on building\u00a0skills and training \u201cto work agilely and flexibly, embracing new technologies\u201d.\nOther plans include\u00a0promoting digital innovation in achieving the strategy\u2019s outcomes; and supporting access to digital solutions with the recognition that \u201colder people, social tenants and people on low incomes are less likely to have access to, or use, the internet\u201d.\nDigital also plays a role in the creation of \u201cresilient communities\u201d and within the focus on care partners and unpaid carers.

In place of the current system of counting SDECs (based on zero-day length of stay), the strategy notes that a national pilot which saw SDEC activity recorded on the emergency care data set has demonstrated \u201cbetter analysis of SDEC-related activity to enable effective data-informed decisions on service provision\u201d. All urgent and emergency care activity is set to be recorded within the emergency care data set by April 2024, which will then provide a \u201csingle source of comprehensive, accurate and timely data\u201d for emergency departments, urgent treatment centres, ambulance services and all other urgent care services in England.\nNHSE goes on to share guidance around the SDEC dashboard on the FutureNHS platform, describing\u00a0 it as \u201cnot a performance monitoring tool, but intended primarily for use at local level\u201d, with useful data for clinical, operational and business intelligence teams.\nThe importance of collecting \u201caccurate and timely\u201d data to evaluate patient experience of SDEC is also raised within the strategy, with NHSE sharing that 10 quality markers have been developed for evaluation of experience, to support SDEC services in considering their delivery of care. The quality markers include elements such as ensuring that people using SDEC are greeted upon arrival, that they have the opportunity to ask questions and give feedback; they can be found in full here.\nRegarding access, the strategy states that SDEC services should be profiled within the directory of services, and notes that the approach to profiling should be standardised across integrated care systems or regional footprints. This should include information such as when referrals are accepted, exclusion criteria, guidance on how to refer and direct contact numbers, with NHSE adding that a \u201cregular comprehensive review\u201d of the directory will assist with increased referrals, \u201csupported by a digital direct referral to the provider\u201d.\nLooking at diagnostics and testing, NHSE states that SDEC providers should review technologies capable of supporting rapid diagnosis of monitoring of conditions, particularly for those that may present acutely; thought should also be given to the development of point-of-care testing to support rapid decision-making.\nOn alternatives to admission, the strategy points out that virtual wards may be suitable for patients with a range of conditions, and suggests that SDEC teams should collaborate with virtual ward colleagues to support patients to remain at home where appropriate.\nA number of resources are included within the strategy, such as self-assessment tools outlining opportunities for improvement; here, NHSE encourages services to examine their use of digital tools in supporting future planning to assist with referrals and sharing patient information, as well as their use of booking tools to streamline services.\nAccess the strategy in full here.\nEarlier this month HTN explored the latest papers from the NHS board meeting, including a focus on progress of digital across the system; catch up here.\nRelatedGoogle Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026NHSE shares update on metrics for urgent and emergency care\u2026Birmingham and Solihull ICS strategy highlights central role\u2026Feature: adding intelligence to data captureDigital Health and Care Wales 2024-2027 primary care\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Digital Health and Care Wales signals 2024-2030 objectives for digital across infrastructure, research, workforce and more", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/21/draft-2024-2030-strategy-from-digital-health-and-care-wales-shares-objectives-for-digital-across-infrastructure-research-workforce-and-more/", "content": "\n\nDigital Health and Care Wales (DHCW) has published its draft organisational strategy 2024-2030, setting out strategic objectives for digital across health and care, including infrastructure, data platform, open architecture, digital services, digital health and care records, research, innovation and workforce, along with a\u00a0request for views\u00a0from partners and stakeholders.\nThe strategy looks to outline DHCW\u2019s role within the Welsh health and care system over the next six years, focusing on five principles including \u201cdesign for more digital, more data\u201d.\n\n\nIn advancing future infrastructure, data platform and open architecture, objectives are to move data stores and services across to the NDR Data platform to \u201ccreate a single national Clinical Data Repository\u201d, as well as redesigning applications and services to \u201ca clean open architecture based on standards which is secure by design\u201d.

Osman kindly shared with us some of the progress updates and insights from NE London.\nAccess to patient records: progress and challenges\nWe started out by asking Osman about progress on improving patient access to medical records.\nOsman said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting roll-out. I think the concern is still around how we protect patients who may have issues relating to safeguarding or domestic abuse, and so on. There are competency or capacity issues we need to be mindful of. If we are allowing automatic access, it\u2019s a question of whether it\u2019s those patients getting the record, or whether it is somebody else getting the record on their behalf. In some cases, that may not be appropriate. There\u2019s been lots of discussions around how best to protect patients; it\u2019s something that practices need to ensure they have in mind when they include information in people\u2019s records. I think that\u2019s going to be the key challenge going forward \u2013 making sure that we are marking records if they contain sensitive information so that it isn\u2019t visible online.\u201d\nHow are staff finding the roll-out? \u201cI think the whole process has been rushed through a bit from the national angle,\u201d Osman reflected, \u201cand that\u2019s been the concern generally. It\u2019s an ongoing process, and primary care is under a lot of stress from different angles anyway. The main focus is very much on trying to ensure that anybody new coming in \u2013 locums, and so on \u2013 are aware of the processes in place for access to patient records.\u201d\nDigital First programme\nOsman discussed some of the projects that he has been involved in through the Digital First programme, which focused on understanding challenges and inefficiencies in existing care pathways with a view to improve them through use of digital or pathway revision.\nFirstly, he shared insight into the breadth of the projects involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the online consultation, or video consultation rollout; there\u2019s been a big focus on GP record access, and we\u2019ve been commended for our facilitation. For a lot of tools that have been rolled out across the patch, we\u2019ve ensured their standardisation, so that all the data going in is the same and therefore we can get good data coming out.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve invested quite heavily with the Digital First programme on people. That\u2019s key \u2013 ensuring that we have got facilitators who can go in and essentially handhold practices through different processes, using the right templates and using things like Microsoft Teams, which has been used as a collaborative tool across multidisciplinary teams.\u201d\nOsman continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work around online registrations, which is being copied into the national programme; we\u2019ve also done a bit of work around the NHS App and ensured that that\u2019s the app of choice across NE London to use as a front door. We\u2019ve built on that, so it can be used for online consultations and ordering prescriptions, and we\u2019re building care plans on the back of it, which is still ongoing through the Patients Know Best portal.\u201d\nIn addition, Osman shared how there has been a focus on delivering consistent website standards; the developing of an online portal for primary care staff so that they can find information with ease; work on capacity; and work on care homes. \u201cOne of the biggest benefits\u00a0of the care home project is that we\u2019ve got a lot of care homes that have complied with the DSP toolkit,\u201d he shared, \u201cand we\u2019ve also done a lot of work with social prescribing, rolling out digital tools for that. That\u2019s just off the top of my head, there\u2019s a lot more!\u201d\nRegarding his learnings from the Digital First programme, Osman answered: \u201cIt\u2019s been a really good journey, and a lot of it has very much been a team effort. It\u2019s been made easier by the fact that we\u2019ve got a great digital team of clinicians who\u2019ve been clinically leading projects, managerial support and project managers who\u2019ve been really on the ball in terms of making sure things get rolled out properly. It\u2019s made it a lot easier than it could have been. Teamwork, collaboration, everybody wanting to achieve together \u2013 they\u2019ve been really positive. Having a monthly catch-up on all of the projects involved was a good idea, and I think we\u2019ve achieved a lot over the last five years which has been a testament to the team.\u201d\nReflections and looking ahead\nWe asked Osman if there are any digital projects he is particularly proud of from the last year.\nHe raised the progress around online registrations and the fact that it was taken on as a national scheme, along with the support around online consultations which he said is a \u201ctestament to the great managerial and clinical leadership\u201d. He explained: \u201cOne of the biggest problems was that we had one tool in North East London, and not all practices were using it. So we came up with a procurement process where we had three tools available and practices could use one of three. That worked really well.\u201d\n\u201cFacilitation, I think, has been a key aspect of all of these things; looking at supporting practices to get tools rolled-out. We\u2019ve done a lot of quality improvement work to go into practices and really facilitate things to last.\u201d\nOpportunities for digital health in primary care for 2024 and beyond\n\u201cI think we need to push for more collaborative working, and work around e-hubs,\u201d Osman said. \u201cHow we do things consistently with collaborative working across a PCN? Something we\u2019re going to hopefully keep going forwards is the fact that if we offer something for one practice in North East London, all practices get it; so there\u2019s some equality of access. With e-hubs, for the next year we have given all of our practices the same offer; so all practices who belong to a PCN can have access to working together through EMIS clinical services, and they all get the same standard of configuration. Whether they are ordering investigations, doing spine services or doing prescriptions, anything that can be done at one practice can be done across the PCN.\u201d\nHe also noted that there is a focus for the future on Patient Knows Best and building care plans into the NHS App, along with building on existing learnings around demand and capacity.\n\u201cThe other thing going forward is related to the staffing issue,\u201d Osman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the question of how we utilise our staff better. Remote working, I think, is going to increase in the year ahead.\u201d\nAre there any areas of digital potential within primary care that NHSE isn\u2019t making the most of at present?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s recurrent investment,\u201d he said. \u201cPresently, a lot of funding is just for a year, but there\u2019s no recurrent funding. I think that\u2019s going to be the key. How do we invest to save in an effective manner? That\u2019s going to be the challenge.\n\u201cIt is getting the basics right; I think we always start jumping up and down for the latest automation solution, which sometimes isn\u2019t all that helpful. We need to look at the foundational elements like\u00a0network infrastructure; do we have good wi-fi? Do we have double monitors on all screens? There\u2019s no point having a fancy tool if you can\u2019t switch the PC on to use it.\u201d\nIf Osman could solve one problem or challenge for digital primary care, it would be\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cIncreasing the number of GPs. There\u2019s a lot of investment into other roles which is welcome, but fundamentally, successive governments have promised more GPs, and we\u2019ve got less. That\u2019s putting a strain on us.\u201d\nApart from that, he said, he would like to enable more remote working, to support existing staff with their ways of working and work-life balance.\nWhat are you most excited about for the future of digital healthcare?\n\u201cI\u2019m most excited about the potential that can come about from\u00a0working collaboratively across e-hubs,\u201d replied Osman. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to be an exciting project that we can then build on, so you can potentially get neighbouring hubs to work together on federation level or wider.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about patient access to medical records \u2013 but doing it safely is key.\u201d\nAnother project that Osman noted is the London Data Service. \u201cThis is really exciting; but again, it needs to be done in a controlled way to ensure that people accessing the data are the people who the data is for,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, we need to ensure that we\u2019ve got good access, not just within our healthcare system, but also the wider team. Pharmacies, dentists, opthamologists, opticians \u2013 it\u2019s that kind of sharing I think we need to improve on as well.\u201d\nWe would like to thank Osman for his time, and for sharing these insights with us.\nFrom our industry view piece back in October, we spoke with Osman and three other representatives from ICSs, on digital priorities in their region \u2013 and what they are looking forward to in the future with regards to digital in health.\nRelatedInterview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026HTN Now: NW London's digital access e-hub for consultations\u2026Interview: Doron Dreyer, Cynerio, on the opportunities and\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Crown Commercial Service opens G-Cloud 14 framework", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/20/crown-commercial-service-opens-g-cloud-14-framework/", "content": "\nCrown Commercial Service has published procurement opportunities for a new framework agreement around the latest iteration of G-Cloud, a UK government initiative aiming to ease procurement of cloud-based computing services including hosting, software and support.\nG-Cloud is designed to help public sector organisations in finding affiliated technology suppliers and purchase services, with the initiative establishing framework agreements with service providers and listing them on the digital marketplace, a publicly accessible portal.

One of the drivers of this is the emergence of virtual care; a fully remote, practical and adaptable approach to providing care \u2013 improving outcomes for patients and healthcare staff.\nThis end-to-end method of identifying a patient\u2019s needs and treating them without the physical presence of a clinician or healthcare professional, has been pivotal to the NHS and has the potential to save hundreds of thousands in bed costs; relieving pressures on doctors and staff and lowering the rate of admissions.\nIn recent years, \u201cvirtual wards,\u201d alongside terms like \u201cremote monitoring\u201d, \u201ctelecare\u201d and \u201ctech-enabled care\u201d, have become commonplace under the virtual care umbrella. Though each term may have a slightly different interpretation, they all share the common theme of relying on remote monitoring tools and alarms to enable patients to receive care at home.\nThe NHS defines these terms as follows:\nTechnology enabled care refers to the use of telehealth, telecare and telemedicine in providing care for people that is convenient, accessible and cost-effective. These services use technology to support people to live safely and independently in their own homes, and can be helpful to people at risk of falls.\nVirtual wards, also referred to as \u2018Hospital at Home\u2019, support patients, who would otherwise be in hospital, to receive the acute care, remote monitoring and treatment they need in their own home or usual place of residence.\nRemote monitoring is the monitoring of a patient (using medical devices, applications, Clinical Investigation results, or assessment tools), to allow a care professional or service to initiate an out-patient appointment when required to manage the patient\u2019s condition.\nThere are many cases where these digital-powered solutions have proven to be highly effective in reducing health risks and improving patient flow in hospitals. Virtual wards are one such solution that has the potential to streamline hospital operations and make them more efficient.\nThe Dawn of Virtual Wards\nVirtual wards are thought to be a more cost-effective alternative to having a person on a hospital ward, and they are helping to alleviate much of the pressure on the UK health system. Using technology-enabled smart devices and software, clinicians can monitor a patient\u2019s vital signs, behaviours and environment without needing to be there in person.\nThanks to these virtual strategies, the NHS were able to meet their 2023 winter target of 10,000 free beds ahead of schedule. Noticeable reductions in staff workloads, hospital admissions and speedier discharges are just some of the results this new, pioneering care framework has delivered, which leads to improved patient wellbeing, lower risks of infection and fewer overheads for keeping a patient in an acute ward.\nThe benefits of virtual wards and virtual care are evident, but numerous hospitals and care units around the country either haven\u2019t yet adopted virtual wards or aren\u2019t fully utilising remote patient technology. There are various reasons for this, such as insufficient funding, improper staff training, and an absence of data/case studies that support their efficiency; however, a lack of integration could also be to blame.\nThe Challenges\nWhen a virtual ward is established, it should work in synergy with the rest of the ICS model. What normally happens instead is a virtual ward is set up, then neglected because it doesn\u2019t receive a sufficient level of ongoing support. This results in siloed data that doesn\u2019t get shared with other systems or software, increasing the administration burden on staff, adding to workloads and leading to uninformed decision making around treatment plans.\nCost and understaffing are fundamental issues also. The NHS has been given a resource budget of \u00a3168.8 billion for 2023/24, of which \u00a3114.3 billion has been allocated to Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) for commissioning local health services. High on the priority list is workforce expansion; hiring staff both domestically and internationally to reduce vacancies, growing the number of qualified health and social care professionals through training and education programmes, improving staff retention rates by creating better workplace conditions, and several other initiatives designed to nurture the workforce now and into the future.\nA lack of staff creates a string of problems. Workloads become overbearing, leading to staff burnout and high absence rates, causing a backlog of tasks, leading to a drop in the standards of care, resulting in bed blocking and delays in patient discharge. Results from the NHS Staff Survey show that 49.3 percent of staff in clinical occupations reported feeling burnt out because of their work in 2022, with chronic stress and anxiety being two of the main causes. Staff that continue to come into work are then burdened with longer hours and additional workloads, which can require them to learn entirely new processes in order to cope with the handover. Inefficient processes, outdated systems and improper admin support can also hinder their ability to perform certain tasks correctly.\nWendy Preston from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said, \u201cThere are over 40,000 nursing vacancies across the NHS, and social care is chronically understaffed. If the UK government wants to turn around the state of the NHS and deliver the \u2018hospital level\u2019 care at home that patients expect, nursing staff need to see game-changing investment in the workforce.\u201d\nIn addition to integration, cost and staffing challenges, there are various perceived barriers to the remote patient monitoring (RPM) aspect of virtual care that have prevented it from being implemented. Whether it\u2019s financial fears around inventory management and shipping devices out to patients, worries over the technology\u2019s efficiency, reluctance from staff to get onboard with the programme, teaching patients how to use the hardware/software, or the reliability and transparency of the data reported \u2013 these are all concerns that have stunted the adoption of RPM for numerous organisations and prevented virtual care from reaching its full potential.\nMaking Virtual Care A Success: Potential Fixes\nThese challenges will continue to inhibit the NHS from working efficiently until appropriate action is taken. While there is no one right answer, or means to solve them all overnight, a strategy that could potentially alleviate pressure and encourage the adoption of virtual care further is integration.\nAn Integrated Model\nIntegration ensures a unified approach to patient management because it promotes interoperability and enables data to be consolidated, reported and shared across different channels. With data readily available, clinicians are better equipped to make informed judgements that align with a patient\u2019s care needs, but more importantly these decisions are more accurate, which means better care outcomes.\nWhether it\u2019s to discharge the patient, refer them to a specialist, or assign them to a virtual ward, integration reinforces these decisions and backs them up with secure, real-time data that healthcare professionals can access and interpret easily.\nIn the long term, a holistic approach to virtual care could make it more sustainable and viable than the current methods used to deliver care. Virtual wards, telecare, and remote care cannot be seen as another new service, nor can they be seen as something separate from the existing ecosystem. They need to be part of the ICS; available across the entire care continuum and ensuring everyone has the full patient picture.\nChanging the Narrative\nMisconceptions around security, privacy, cost, and the \u201cde-humanising\u201d aspect of virtual care have raised scepticism about the technology\u2019s capabilities and its implementation. As a result, patients and some clinicians are reluctant to leave the comfort and familiarity of traditional methods for delivering care.\nDebunking these myths and highlighting the clear benefits of virtual health may offer the peace of mind people need to get on board. Placing particular emphasis on the following points may also provide a better understanding of how and why it works:\n\nMost, if not all, technology-enabled care services currently used by ICSs are data secure and GDPR compliant.\nOperational efficiency is enhanced by reducing the number of face-to-face visits and relieving the burden on acute care settings.\nClinicians have access to real-time insights and analytics and can take action quickly. This reduces the need for appointments and having to deal with long wait times, patient Did Not Attends or the unavailability of doctors.\nDrives down costs by eliminating unnecessary visits and travel expenses for patients. Money is also saved through the reduction of hospital readmissions.\nThe familiarity of care in a home setting leads to improved patient wellbeing. Patients are five times less likely to pick up an infection recovering at home, and eight times less likely to experience functional decline.\n\nAbove all else, a solid foundation of trust is needed for this framework to be a success. That means strengthening the relationship between patients and doctors, so patients feel confident to use the technology and empowered to manage their own health, and doctors are given the time and resources to deliver quality, personalised care by entrusting their patients to do so. With these measures in place and integration at the core, virtual care is poised to be a success.\nWhere Next?\nAccording to Nuffield Trust, more than 15 million people in the UK live with a long-term condition (LTC). Close to 70 percent of the health and social care budget is spent on caring for people in this group, which is responsible for more than 50 percent of all GP consultations and accounts for almost 70 percent of NHS bed occupancy.\nAge is a natural cause of functional decline, with people becoming increasingly more frail and prone to disability, seizures, falls, and degenerative diseases after the age of 65. A sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity accelerates the progression of these long-term health conditions, as does a poor diet, an irregular sleep pattern, and unhealthy consumption of tobacco and alcohol.\nThe NHS has an existing strategy for identifying and supporting those with long-term illnesses, but this is only half the battle. Preventing patients from being admitted into hospital or needing costly ongoing treatment in the first place is the real challenge.\nThis is why a joined-up care model is so integral in keeping LTC patients from deteriorating once their condition(s) have been recognised and recorded. The only way this model will work is by unifying primary, acute and community services so that patients have improved access to treatment and care.\nVirtual wards, remote monitoring, tech-enabled care, and telecare all have their part to play in this. Whether it\u2019s empowering patients to self-manage their health at home using wearables and smartphone diagnostic tools, providing them access to social prescribing services and community support, or setting aside funds to build robust, personalised care plans \u2013 all these things together can have an enormously positive impact on a person\u2019s mental and physical health, equalling a better quality of life.\nVirtual care is leading the way in all of this and we at Access will continue to champion its potential to transform the health sector and provide health and care workers with the tools to make a difference.\nRelatedHTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Feature: adding intelligence to data captureStudy explores potential for 999 calls to be \"video live\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u2026Featured interview: Luscii and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Digital Health and Care Wales seeks to procure \u00a31.4 million medicines information solution and drugs tool", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/19/digital-health-and-care-wales-seeks-to-procure-1-4-million-medicines-information-solution-and-drugs-tool/", "content": "\nDigital Health and Care Wales has opened an opportunity stating its intention to procure a medicines information solution and drugs tool, at an estimated value of more than \u00a31.4 million.

It has a loading speed of \u201cup to 750 packs per hour\u201d, and can identify short-dated medications for use first, helping improve stock management.\nAndrea Ashton, associate director of pharmacy and chief pharmacy technician, said: \u201cWhilst the work is underway, we have contingencies to reduce the impact on patients and service users, however we anticipate there may be some delay. Patients and their relatives can help by bringing into hospital medicines they currently take, this also helps with reducing missed doses, improves continuity of care during an inpatient stay and minimises the time it takes to prepare medicines for discharge.\u201d\nPilot of app to encourage sobriety at Royal Free London inspires national study\u00a0\nThe pilot of an app designed to encourage patients with alcohol-related liver disease to stay sober at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust has led to a national NIHR-funded study aiming to evaluate cost-effectiveness and consider target populations for the intervention.\nFocusing on behavioural change, the AlcoChange app\u2019s functions include a mobile phone-based breathalyser, and personalised messages such as reminders of financial savings, pictures of loved ones, and solutions to overcome cravings.\nDuring the original pilot study, 57 percent of those using the AlcoChange app \u201cremained abstinent over a three month period\u201d, compared with 22 percent of those not using the app regularly, and the intervention group reported fewer hospital admissions a year after last using it.\nRajiv Jalan, professor of hepatology, consultant physician, and co-founder of the app\u2019s developers Cyberliver Ltd, said: \u201cIt is exciting to see the positive results of this study. Harnessing digital technology has the potential to revolutionise the management of patients with liver disease as it can be delivered continuously at home, reducing the need for patients having to travel and impacting dramatically on costs of healthcare delivery.\u201d\nNew stroke treatment using portable device tested in Sheffield\nA stroke treatment to improve hand and arm weakness is being tested by researchers from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Sheffield, with funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research, the Medical Research Council and the Association of British Neurologists Fellowship.\nThe \u00a32 million TRICEPS trial features the use of a portable, pacemaker-like device, which delivers stimulation to damaged parts of the brain when the arm is moved during therapy, linked to an earpiece which \u201cgently tickles the ear\u201d, to stimulate the vagus nerve. It is set to enrol up to 243 patients from 15 UK stroke centres over the next two years, who will be asked to wear the device for one hour, five times per week, to carry out their therapy at home, supported by community physios and occupational therapists.\nProfessor Arshad Majid, consultant neurologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals and professor of cerebrovascular neurology at the University of Sheffield, shared that in a smaller preliminary trial, it was shown that gently tickling a nerve at the ear using mild electrical pulses \u201cimproved arm and hand weakness after stroke when used in conjunction with stroke rehabilitation therapy.\u201d\nIn the new trial, Arshad added, the team hope to \u201cestablish if these findings can be replicated in larger numbers of patients, without the need for surgery, so that stroke survivors can access transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation as part of their at-home rehabilitative therapy and care. By conducting this trial, we also hope to provide definitive answers as to whether this is an effective approach in improving recovery after stroke that can be rolled out at scale to large numbers of patients on the NHS.\u201d\nOur last news in brief looked at an upgraded catheterisation lab in Birmingham, sight loss e-learning in Shropshire, a virtual ward update from Cornwall, and more.\nRelatedNews in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026HTN Now: NW London's digital access e-hub for consultations\u2026HTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026Norfolk and Waveney ICB among eight organisations joining\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Predictive modelling, data dashboards and early warning systems feature in strategic data themes from Somerset NHS", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/08/predictive-modelling-data-dashboards-and-early-warning-systems-feature-in-strategic-data-themes-from-somerset-nft/", "content": "\nSomerset NHS Foundation Trust\u2019s digital strategy strategic data themes focus on the four core principles of predict, prepare, prevent and improve, setting out planned actions including providing training for staff on predictive modelling, developing tools so that front-end users can create their own data dashboards; and developing early warning systems designed to help reduce risk to patients and to monitor pressure and capacity across the ICS.\nUnder predict, actions in four key areas focus on predictive data, data science and artificial intelligence, data engineering and prescriptive data. Along with predictive modelling training for staff, these actions include identifying opportunities to enhance reporting using predictive techniques like clustering; developing decision support tools; allocating 30 percent of the data professional budget to \u201cpreparing the organisation for the future\u201d; ensuring data architecture is modernised; ensuring that data professionals are \u201cgiven the appropriate training to understand and respond to the latest cybersecurity threats\u201d; using simulation models to avoid making \u201cunnecessary and costly change\u201d; and creating simulations of the waiting list to give staff an insight into impacts of planned interventions.\nOn supporting work around keeping the trust prepared, Somerset shares plans across emergency preparedness, resilience and response, patient and public engagement, data on demand, and open ways of working. These actions include quantifying the impact of large events to ensure sufficient response from services; creating tools to monitor population health and demographic changes; forming data sharing agreements to ensure visibility of 999, 111, and other provider data for region-wide planning; and the delivery of a comms package to ensure the public and patients are informed about the use of their data. Additionally, the trust pledges to ensure that the public have a voice in the use of their data, and to ensure that \u201ccritical business areas\u201d have access to live data; to develop tools to enable front-end users to create their own dashboards; and to promote the use of free and open-source software where possible.\nSystem-wide planning, risk stratification, early warning systems and population health are the key focuses for prevention within the strategy. Here, the trust plans to provide linked datasets between the trust, primary and social care; to bring data professionals from across the system into the same \u201cvirtual team\u201d to ensure consistency in approach; and to adopt common standards and tools for interoperability. Somerset will also work on developing tools to identify at-risk populations; develop early warning systems to reduce risk to patients and to monitor pressure and capacity across the ICS; and use data science modelling techniques to improve operational workflows.\nAround the principle of improvements, Somerset places emphasis on research, data literacy, innovation culture, and service improvement. Encouraging staff to participate in research, ensuring the trust is meeting obligations under the Secure Data Environment and training staff on data literacy are some of the actions planned in this area; along with ensuring that leaders have the skills needed to make \u201cwell informed data driven decisions\u201d and creating a single access point for data requests. In addition, Somerset notes the need to ensure that AI and other analytical techniques are \u201cconducted within a safe, ethical, and transparent framework\u201d; to work toward the NHS Digital Architecture Principles; to prioritise data requests based on potential to drive improvement; and to ensure that data professionals are available to provide advice.\nThe publication can be found in full here.\nIn other news on data, a new health and wellbeing strategy spanning 2024-2030 has been published by Oxfordshire Health and Wellbeing Board, highlighting digital and data as key enablers and pledging to \u201cimprove the extent, quality, and accessibility of digital infrastructure and more effectively generate insight from data to inform decision making\u201d.\nElsewhere, the latest strategy from University Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) NHS Trust lists digital and data as enablers of success with a \u201cnew continuous improvement approach\u201d planned to drive large-scale transformation, underpinned by programmes including digital and technology.\nRelatedGoogle Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026Birmingham and Solihull ICS strategy highlights central role\u2026Feature: adding intelligence to data capture\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Legacy information systems: approaches from across the NHS", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/08/legacy-information-systems-approaches-from-across-the-nhs/", "content": "\nAs part of this week\u2019s focus on legacy information systems, we\u2019re exploring views from NHS professionals on their organisation\u2019s approach.\nMark Chester, assistant director of digital services at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u201cAll organisations face challenges with legacy systems and what happens to the data within that system once it has been replaced. This challenge is made even harder in the NHS due to the variety of systems in use and requirements to maintain data for differing periods of time. Maintaining legacy systems within the NHS not only poses significant cyber security challenges it is also an expensive way to maintain historical data, as quite often maintenance costs on legacy systems is very high.\n\u201cUniversity Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust was formed in 2018 following the merger of Derby Teaching Hospitals and Burton Hospitals. The trust has taken the approach to decommission legacy systems as soon as possible and to migrate any data remaining in those systems into a single cloud based data archive system (Bridgehead Healthstore). This system does not replicate the original system, but allows the data to be stored in such a way that clinicians can easily access the data from links within the core electronic patient record. The system is built in such a way that the data is presented to the clinician in an easy to read format so that they can quickly and easily refer back to historical data when treating patients. In addition, as the data is also held as discrete data items, other tools such as PowerBI can be used to query the data specialist reports are required\n\u201cWith the system being cloud based, it is easy to expand the system to incorporate more patient data as systems are decommissioned. This system will play a key role over the next three years as the trust migrates from using two separate electronic patient record systems onto a single system. \u00a0Not only will it ensure that the data is still available for patient care but it will also save money for the trust in not having to maintain the legacy EPRs.\u201d\nWhen we interviewed Lorna Allen, chief digital and information officer at Northern Care Alliance, she commented on the need to monitor challenges on an ongoing basis. \u201cSometimes you need to make a conscious compromise about how fast you need to launch a service if you\u2019ve got an urgent need \u2013 I think all organisations have to do that. That\u2019s okay, but organisations should make sure that they note it down and keep a record of the compromise so that they can regularly check on it and make sure that it\u2019s still okay. But you need to know when to take action. We\u2019re seeing this at the moment in the Northern Care Alliance with legacy buildings and legacy systems; we have some selective choices to make and some fundamental changes to undertake. This all feeds into the development of your digital strategy,\u201d Lorna stated.\nReflecting on her previous experience in the corporate sector as well as the NHS, she added: \u201cThere are always challenges around the age of systems, the integration abilities, the extracting of data. They are common issues across every organisation I\u2019ve worked in.\u201d\nWe recently heard from Matthew Hopkins, chief executive at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, on the trust\u2019s digital progress so far as well as priorities. Matthew shared that Mid and South Essex has \u201cstarted a major transformational programme, working in partnership with Essex Partnership University Foundation Trust, to implement a first of type system-wide EPR. This programme connects patient data across community, mental health and acute care settings, and will change the way we deliver care to embed truly integrated whole system pathways.\u201d\nTo underpin this, he continued, and to ensure focus on safety and security, the trust has \u201cbegun a sustained programme of investment in our foundational technology that will bring the legacy systems of previously separate hospitals together as a single trust configuration. We recognise that having a sound technology base is critical for supporting patient safety, connected care and innovation into the future.\u201d\nDr Penny Kechagioglou, chief clinical information officer and deputy chief medical officer at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwick, raised legacy systems as a key challenge that her trust has faced. \u201cIf I were to break down the challenges, I\u2019d categorise them as technical challenges like legacy systems that we\u2019re trying to solve and bring together and decommission, and infrastructure \u2013 how we are going to use our existing infrastructure and build on it, for example so that it can be more efficient for remote working and remote patient monitoring,\u201d she said.\nShe added that another challenge here is that \u201cdigital transformation is happening really fast. There is a lot of conflict between transformation and change and \u2018business as usual\u2019 because our organisation is very busy at present delivering above and beyond our usual service targets. As a result, change activities often come into conflict with the day-to-day business deliverables and what changes we need to make to support big programmes like the EPR and other digital projects.\u201d\nWe spoke with previous chief information officer from The Royal Marsden, David Newey, on digital programmes including the trust\u2019s EPR go-live last spring. David described how the implementation was not just a case of launching a new EPR, \u201cit was replacing our existing EPR which we had developed in-house. Also, we were extending the coverage to incorporate the replacement of the JAC pharmacy system and the Technidata laboratory system.\u201d Both of these areas are \u201cvery complex to address on their own\u201d, David said, aside from the rest of the EPR implementation.\nAlong with deploying over 6,000 devices, redeveloping more than 90 interfaces and testing over 4,000 devices across a 10-week period, The Royal Marsden needed to migrate data over from their legacy EPR.\n\u201cOne of the ways we approached this was by developing our legacy clinical viewer,\u201d David said, describing this as a \u201cfully embedded read-only view of our old EPR data\u201d providing the trust with around 30 years of historical data. \u201cWe developed this from the ground up, mainly because our old EPR was solely reliant on internet explorer 11. We had to ensure that the legacy viewer was able to run on modern browser technology.\u201d\nCatch up with David\u2019s interview in full, including advice for teams approaching EPR go-lives, here.\nChris Mason, chief information officer at Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, also shared his experience of tackling legacy systems with us. He explained that one of the first projects he undertook at Wirral involved decommissioning their legacy system, with the trust\u2019s first intention to move what they already had within their legacy system and build upon it. \u201cWe already had some sort of digital care pathways, the inpatients PAS, an element of e-prescribing,\u201d said Chris. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got the vast majority of our medical devices integrated into our EPR with all of that data flowing in from our medical devices. Where we have specialist systems, again the vast majority are integrated with a small amount of specialisms still to go. Most of our clinicians probably only log into one system, which is great. It\u2019s a one-stop shop for everything.\u201d\nEarlier in the week, we chatted with BridgeHead Software\u2019s vice president of global marketing, John McCann, on legacy systems \u2013 from the different kinds of legacy applications to the challenges they pose and BridgeHead\u2019s solution for tackling those challenges.

We\u2019re making sure their data is correct when they go into the patient records, and when they need to go through the system.\u201d\nA continued wave of transformation \nThe transformation programme at CHFT, has been ongoing since 2015. Rob explained that it started off with a tactical programme that looked at replacing a lot of older systems, which preceded a \u201cbig bang\u201d EPR go-live.\n\u201cWe tried a couple of times at landing big optimisation programmes off the back of that go-live, but due to the costs and financial pressures across the system, they never really got off the ground. So, what we\u2019ve done instead is we\u2019ve broken that down into smaller pieces, and we\u2019ve looked at things that have caused us issues within the trust, and how we can take the solid digital foundation we\u2019ve got to make improvements.\u201d\nGraham concurs: \u201cAs Rob says, breaking things down into smaller pieces is an effective strategy. Kodak Alaris has completed many projects within trust\u2019s medical records management departments, making sure their data is correct is imperative, and there\u2019s two areas that we look at \u2013 the forward scanning and the back scanning.\n\u201cFor example, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (UH Bristol) which comprises nine hospital sites, had an incredibly large medical records library \u2013 about 1.5 million active patient records and in the region of another million non-active records that had to be retained. Despite seven large libraries onsite to store records, it also had over 200,000 records stored securely off-site, and the associated cost was substantial,\u201d he explained.\nUH Bristol had a small in-house scanning bureau, however, the volumes it was scanning were quite small \u2013 the legacy bureau processed a couple of hundred sheets per week, scanning archive notes etc. into an old trust-based system.\nDigitise records on-demand\nThe primary driver for accelerating and extending the trust\u2019s digital transformation was to mitigate the risk around having separate patient casenotes for separate sites. Adopting a site by site approach, the starting point was to digitise records on-demand.\nWorking in partnership, Kodak Alaris and Kainos supported the trust in expanding its in-house scanning capability, installing ten scanners from Kodak Alaris and deploying the Kainos Evolve Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system.\n\u201cPrior to a patient attending an elective appointment their information was scanned and migrated into the Kainos Evolve platform. The digital file relating to that hospital was then available to all clinicians who could access it. This allowed each hospital to have their own \u2018go-live\u2019, without impacting records at other sites. This promoted a slick and successful business change management process in each of the hospitals,\u201d Graham explained.\nBack scanning old libraries was also conducted in the background, with the end goal of achieving an entirely paper casenote free environment site by site, and repurposing the space previously used for medical records libraries for clinical use.\nManaging and understanding data key to success\nGraham continued: \u201cIt\u2019s about engaging with the NHS trust \u2013 it\u2019s about having those conversations and guiding them to relieve some other pressures that they have at the back office that nobody sees, to take away that pain of manually extracting documents and manually checking documents and improve that patient records system.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at how they do their quality audits and making sure that, as they\u2019ve moved forward, they get the right information from the right patient. We find it encouraging that people want to engage on this now, and I think managing data and understanding that data is the key to success.\u201d\nReturn on investment\nScanners from Kodak Alaris are certified by the leading EMR vendors and have won many industry awards for image quality, data accuracy, and reliability. The simple integration with healthcare systems allows for efficient data capture from various document types directly into EMR systems, eliminating the need for manual data entry.\nKodak Alaris\u2019 approach means trusts benefit from one platform and one supplier, which, says Graham, delivers a quick return on investment. \u201cInstead of being over five years or three years, it can be a 12-to-18-month period, which helps with budgeting,\u201d he said.\nAs a case in point, he explained how by using scanners from Kodak Alaris to drive unprecedented productivity, St Helens & Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust digitised over 135,000 medical records at its two hospital sites.\n\u201cThe trust\u2019s primary objective was to improve patient safety and care by improving access to patient records and it also stated a desire to achieve cost savings across time and file storage. Partnering with Kodak Alaris helped the trust achieve \u00a31.4 million annual savings from a \u00a31.2 million investment,\u201d Graham said.\nKodak Alaris also helped Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust complete an electronic medical records system to digitise 450,000 patient records. \u201cThere was a strong RoI here too. The project delivered savings totalling \u00a31 million per year in reduced operating costs and \u00a31.6 million per annum in improved efficiencies across the trust.\u201d\nBringing data together\nGraham continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been developing our data product KODAK Info Input Solution and we\u2019re working with trusts to bring data together, where you can have information coming from a physical document, a PDF, or an electronic file, and we can pass it through to the care systems, or the EPR systems, within one platform, making it a really seamless process that will bring a lot of advantages.\u201d\nAs part of its goal to exploit the potential of digital technologies to better engage with patients and enhance care quality; University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB), \u00a0selected Kodak Alaris and its partner Insight to assist them in driving internal efficiencies by improving the quality and accessibility of patient health records to clinicians.\nKodak Alaris evaluated the trust\u2019s existing processes for scanning patient referrals into its content management platform and recommended integrating the capture function within line of business systems to remove complexity and enable frontline medical staff to capture and file relevant content at their desktop.\nWith the new solution, instead of passing hard copy documents onto a third-party for scanning and filing in the correct place, a process which typically has a 24-48-hour lead time, the clinician can now capture and file in real-time.\nThe solution is powered by an Info Input Solution scan button app within the UHB\u2019s existing IBM Coach Web portal that is connected to the trust\u2019s fleet of scanners including the KODAK i2400 Scanner and the KODAK i40 Scanner mid-volume production models.\nUsing the embedded scan button and a connected scanner, staff can digitise paper documents and upload the digital records into its legacy EMC Documentum content management system right at the beginning of the patient\u2019s journey.\nThe KODAK Info Input Solution software determines the document type for correct processing after scanning and converts all scanned digital uploads to a bi-tonal searchable PDF file format. Furthermore, document images and subsequent metadata input via the trust\u2019s IBM Coach application is stored in the relevant patient folder located in the UHB\u2019s 7.1 EMC Documentum system.\nIn conclusion, Graham said: \u201cWe\u2019re making sure that every piece of information and data is correct and accurate, to bring that performance and productivity to the front end, whilst really looking after the patients.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the awareness to our partners in the NHS trusts we\u2019ve been working with for over three decades on data capture and data management, that we\u2019re here to help, we\u2019re here to guide, and we can help with data transformation, especially in the one-platform scenario.\u201d\nFor more information please click here.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Calderdale Council awards \u00a3130k contract for digital platform to support family hubs", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/07/calderdale-council-awards-130k-contract-for-digital-platform-to-support-family-hubs/", "content": "\nThe borough council of Calderdale has awarded a contract with an estimated value of \u00a3130,560 across a 10-year period to Gemstone IT Services, for the provision of an integrated virtual health and wellbeing offer for families.\nThe solution is required to act as \u201can umbrella first point of contact\u201d, signposting to further resources and websites as required to support the health and wellbeing of children and young people.

In order to assess clinical effectiveness, the study also compared survival outcomes and readmission rates\u00a0to the hospital within six months of discharge.\nOn length of stay, the study found that overall patients experienced a shorter stay in virtual wards in comparison to matched counterparts in the hospital, with the authors estimating a reduction in hospital stay ranging from 2.1 days to 3.9 days for virtual ward patients. They noted that \u201ca slightly higher percentage\u201d of patients admitted to virtual wards were alive on the six-month follow-up date; however, readmission date within six months after discharge was also higher for patients admitted to virtual wards.\nLooking at economic implications, the authors highlight that virtual ward cost was calculated from accrued expenditure whilst cost estimation for hospital bed says \u201crepresents the average cost of non-elective care provision in wards on the acute hospital site\u201d, calculated by the finance department within the organisation and using NHS-agreed methodology.\u00a0 For virtual wards, during the calendar year 2022 the costs for the virtual ward are estimated to be around \u00a31 million for 40 virtual ward beds. With 366 patients admitted to the virtual ward during the study period, these figures suggest that\u00a0\u201cthe cost of saving one inpatient hospital day was \u00a3935\u201d, however the cost was\u00a0calculated based on 24% of the potential usage of the virtual ward.\nDiscussing their results, for the virtual ward patients who are not readmitted, \u201ccare is shown to be non-inferior\u201d, with other studies indicating that \u201ccare in virtual wards is preferred by patients and also by the healthcare staff\u201d.\nOn survival rates, the authors highlight that although patients from the two groups were matched, virtual ward patients \u201cshowed a lower frequency of comorbidities, which may have contributed to a larger survival rate on their first admission when compared with hospital patients\u201d. They suggest that this could have led to selection bias towards fitter patients when patients are selected for admission to virtual wards.\nImplications for the deployment of large-scale virtual wards are also raised in relation to costs, with the authors stating: \u201cWhile the virtual ward is shown to be an effective way to reduce hospital stays, it requires more carers and is more expensive than a traditional hospital stay.\u201d In order to be cost-effective, they suggest that virtual ward needs to double throughput; in order to be cost-effective and provide a saving on traditional care, they \u201cneed to aspire to triple throughput\u201d.\nUltimately, the authors write, their study concludes that the virtual ward \u201cremains a clinically effective way to care for patients\u201d but potentially \u201cnot a cost-effective or efficient way to care for patients\u201d.\nCitation: Jalilian\u00a0A,\u00a0Sedda\u00a0L,\u00a0Unsworth\u00a0A, et al, Length of stay and economic sustainability of virtual ward care in a medium-sized hospital of the UK: a retrospective longitudinal study BMJ Open 2024;14:e081378.\u00a0doi:\u00a010.1136/bmjopen-2023-081378\nIn other news around virtual wards, in January we reported that NHS England awarded a contract with a reported value of \u00a398,237.70 to Health Innovation Network for a review of the London region\u2019s virtual ward and remote monitoring programme.\nWe also shared an update from Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust on its virtual ward programme, detailing its approach and some of the benefits.\nRelatedLondon independent hospital signs contract for web-based EPRHTN at Rewired 2024: what have we learned from virtual\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u2026Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\u2026Royal Orthopaedic Hospital strategy highlights plans for\u2026Featured interview: Luscii and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Feature: \u201cSystems are changing all the time\u201d, BridgeHead Software\u2019s John McCann on tackling legacy systems", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/06/feature-systems-are-changing-all-the-time-bridgehead-softwares-john-mccann-on-tackling-legacy-systems/", "content": "\nWe sat down with BridgeHead Software\u2019s vice president of global marketing, John McCann, for a chat on legacy systems \u2013 from the different kinds of legacy applications to the challenges they pose and BridgeHead\u2019s solution for tackling those challenges.\nWhat are legacy applications and why are they a problem?\nJohn opened the conversation offering his perspective on the prevalence of legacy applications and the impact they are having on NHS healthcare organisations.\n\u201cIn healthcare, legacy applications are everywhere! But this is not a new phenomenon \u2013 they have been around since the evolution of digital systems. However, the burden and challenges associated with legacy systems for the NHS and, indeed, hospitals across the globe, are being felt like never before given the focus on digital transformation.\u201d\nJohn then talked about what constitutes legacy applications, suggesting they\u2019re not always what some may think.\n\u201cLegacy applications tend to fall under three categories,\u201d he began. \u201cFirstly, there\u2019s the one that most associate with legacy systems; that\u2019s where trusts have an application sat on a random server where no one knows what it is, where it came from, what it does, or who is responsible for it. Nobody wants to touch it in case it falls over; and there is a perception that the data it contains carries less value. So, it\u2019s often the case that these systems are simply left alone.\u201d\nThe second tier of legacy applications are common in private health systems (such as those in the US) but, John noted, also occur in the NHS: duplicate applications. \u201cWe tend to see a lot of duplicate applications following an NHS merger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working with University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust \u2013 their merger has seen them become the tenth largest trust in the country. Bringing together two large hospitals means you end up with a lot of duplicate systems! No one wants to run multiple applications that are, essentially, doing the same job. Consequently, trusts generally decide to consolidate and standardise their application estate. This means that at least one of the duplicate applications will become the default system, while the other(s) will be taken out of production and ultimately become legacy systems. But imagine this situation when you multiply the number of duplicate applications across the various hospital departments.\u201d\nThe third type, and the most common in John\u2019s view, is the case where a trust simply purchases a new system to replace an old one. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of this at the moment, especially with funding coming in from the frontline digitisation programme for new EPR solutions,\u201d John noted. \u201cThere\u2019s also funding for diagnostic modernisation and cybersecurity where newer, fuller-featured systems are being procured to replace older applications \u2013 all of which increase the number of legacy applications trusts then have to manage.\u201d\n\u2026 and the benefits of tackling them\n\u201cIn this ever-evolving digital landscape, applications are being sourced all the time,\u201d John pointed out. \u201cSome are high profile systems, like EPRs; but many are departmental and/or clinical systems, such as laboratory information systems (LIMS), picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and more. But this creates a number of problems.\u201d\nJohn went on to share several key reasons why organisations need to tackle their legacy applications and the challenges they present.\nProblems accessing data\nJohn explained that access to data on legacy applications poses a number of issues. \u201cIf you have long-term patients, with multiple morbidities, clinicians need access to a rich patient history. When organisations replace a system, it\u2019s often assumed that all the data is simply migrated from the old one to the new. But, in my experience, it is commonplace that only a year or two\u2019s worth of data is migrated over. If your outgoing system has been running for 10 years, what happens to the other eight years of data? And how can trusts make that data available to caregivers as part of the longitudinal patient record?\u201d\nCost\nJohn continued, \u201cAs a result, we often see trusts keeping their old applications running even after replacing that system. Their motivations are to comply with data retention policies, prevent data loss and, most importantly, provide access to historical patient records. However, the costs associated with keeping two systems running are untenable. Trusts end up with a double count on licensing costs, support and maintenance contracts, as well as server room space, power, cooling, etc. At a time where NHS budgets are stretched, this is one of the reasons we are seeing more trusts looking to take action.\u201d\nUnnecessary burden on IT and clinical staff\nMaintaining a trust\u2019s legacy application estate is a significant additional burden for IT departments, but also has implications on the workload for clinicians.\nAs John outlined, \u201cGiven the budget and resource constraints across the NHS, IT departments are often asked to \u2018do more with less\u2019, with teams constantly searching for ways to improve efficiencies. But the prevalence of legacy applications is definitely not helping the cause. For IT teams, managing these legacy systems takes up a disproportionate amount of time and manpower. This is wasted effort that could be put to better use on other projects.\n\u201cAnd clinicians want to be able to easily search and retrieve all of the patient data they require to make informed care decisions,\u201d John explained. \u201cBut this patient data is spread across many systems that generally don\u2019t talk to one other, which is especially the case with legacy applications. As a result, clinicians are expected to log into both the new and old applications in order to access the information they need. Is it reasonable for clinicians to have to hunt down this data instead of spending quality time with their patients? I\u2019m also told that if data isn\u2019t readily accessible, sometimes care decisions are made purely on the information at hand \u2013 but this could be an incomplete picture of a patient\u2019s history and, therefore, carries clinical risk. As a health tech vendor, we see it as our duty to try and make things easier for care givers who are already experiencing a high level of \u2018burn out\u2019.\u201d\nCybersecurity\n\u201cCybersecurity is a huge issue for the NHS and the healthcare industry globally. In terms of cyberattacks, it\u2019s generally understood that it\u2019s not a case of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when\u2019, with legacy applications contributing to the serious threat posed by cybercriminals,\u201d John stated. \u201cAs legacy applications age, the software and the hardware they sit on become more vulnerable. Invariably, this creates security loopholes, especially if those older systems are no longer supported. As such, these applications become obvious targets for ransomware and malware attacks.\n\u201cIncreasingly, we are seeing legacy systems that carry the highest risk being placed on a trust\u2019s risk register; as well as being declared as part of the Data Security and Protection Toolkit assessment. It\u2019s clear the potential of these cybersecurity incidents are driving action within trusts to do something about their legacy applications in an attempt to reduce the threat surface.\u201d\nAI and future tech\nJohn noted the rising interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning within healthcare. \u201cAI requires large datasets to work to best effect,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, there is an enormous amount of untapped historical data trapped in siloed legacy systems that could and should be put to work. In order for AI and other technologies to benefit from this data, it must be freed \u2013 one of the things we are trying to help our customers with \u2013 to break down these silos and leverage their data as a strategic asset.\u201d\nHow is BridgeHead helping trusts with their legacy applications?\nWe asked John how BridgeHead Software is helping trusts to tackle their challenges regarding legacy applications.\nJohn said: \u201cBridgeHead has developed a solution called HealthStore\u00ae. HealthStore is an enterprise-wide, FHIR-enabled, interoperable Clinical Data Repository (CDR), which is being adopted by the NHS and across the world to consolidate and retire legacy, duplicate, or replaced applications while preserving access and leveraging the value of the data they contain.\n\u201cHealthStore ingests a wide array of data and data types from an array of legacy and live systems,\u201d explained John. \u201cThis can be documents, medical images (DICOM and non-DICOM), and even discreet data values, such as blood results. For example, we can take in each individual numerical value from a lab report into HealthStore and associate it directly with the appropriate patient identifiers. And this last point is really important \u2013 we ensure all of the data we ingest into HealthStore is correctly aligned to the right patient.\n\u201cOnce the data has been extracted from your legacy system and ingested into HealthStore, that legacy application can be decommissioned, eliminating the problems we highlighted earlier, whilst providing a future-proof, interoperable platform for centralising patient data living outside of your EPR. But, most importantly, your full patient\u2019s history is readily available and accessible to clinicians, as and where needed, to support care decisions.\u201d\nJohn explained that once patient data is held in HealthStore, it is stored efficiently and intelligently; fully protected so it can be quickly recovered in the event of an outage, corruption, or cyberattack; and it can be securely accessed by clinicians and support staff directly (via a web browser) or integrated with an EPR or other primary systems, displaying results in \u2018patient context\u2019.\nHealthStore in action \nUniversity Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust (UHDB) is BridgeHead\u2019s \u2018flagship\u2019 customer in the UK in terms of using HealthStore to retire its legacy applications. BridgeHead has supported the Trust in migrating historical data from a range of legacy systems into HealthStore, with estimated annual cost savings of \u00a3250,000 so far.\n\u201cUHDB really bought into the HealthStore vision and have ambitious plans for the solution,\u201d John shared. \u201cThe trust began its HealthStore journey focusing on applications with identified hardware problems that were classified as a risk due to the possibility of unrecoverable system failure, when data was still being regularly accessed \u2013 hence being handpicked as the starting point for the HealthStore project.\u201d The aftermath of the merger of Derby and Burton hospitals has led to further plans for application consolidation, with HealthStore at the heart. John noted that a trust\u2019s return on investment for HealthStore increases as you retire more applications and consolidate data within the solution.\nJohn also shared that Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a long-standing HealthStore customer (initially utilising the solution to manage its radiology images since the end of the National Program for IT), had recently migrated data from its legacy cardiology vendor-neutral archive into HealthStore, enabling the trust to decommission the application.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working with a number of other healthcare organisations,\u201d John said, citing\u00a0The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital and the Government of Jersey as examples, \u201call of whom share similar issues regarding their legacy application estate.\u201d\nPriorities for the year ahead\nLooking to the year ahead, John commented on the upcoming general election.\n\u201cWith any change in the political landscape, healthcare is impacted,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s both an opportunity and a threat, as the prioritisation and level of investment for the NHS is often dependent on election results. Leading up to elections can also be difficult with projects coming to a standstill or funding placed on hold. Hopefully, when we emerge on the other side, we\u2019ll see the much-needed investment in technology and infrastructure for the NHS.\u201d\nHe added that the pandemic brought with it a lesson: initiatives can move very quickly under the right conditions. \u201cI was amazed at the speed of innovation and delivery during COVID \u2013 it shows what can be done in a time of crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovation is critical to future success. And it\u2019s often a partnership between the vendor community and the NHS where innovation really takes off. Together, we can seek out angles for streamlining processes and improving efficiencies, especially in how we empower frontline staff.\u201d\nJohn also predicted a \u201cmassive focus on cybersecurity\u201d, based on the premise that hackers are becoming more sophisticated by the day. \u201cCybersecurity will be a key topic for the coming year. With healthcare a key target, the NHS is having to constantly stay abreast of the latest cyber threats. It\u2019s also about having the correct processes and tools in place not only to prevent attacks, but to bounce back quickly and reduce the impact following a cyber incident.\u201d\nBridgeHead is currently developing an initiative which John described as \u2018cyberattack mitigation\u2019, largely leveraging solutions the company already has in place but in a different way, which he believes will provide hospitals something quite unique. \u201cWe have developed a three-point plan to help mitigate the effects of a cyberattack,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are: 1) reduce the cyberattack threat surface; 2) ensure clinical continuity during an attack (by avoiding or reducing the initiation of manual workloads); and 3) the ability to recover compromised systems quickly and efficiently, so as to resume hospital operations as soon as possible. With this solution, we hope to address questions such as \u2018how do you carry on your daily operations and feed information to clinicians, when they need it, during a cyberattack?\u2019. We are pretty excited about it, so watch this space.\u201d\nMany thanks to John for joining us and for sharing his thoughts.\nRelatedNew systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Feature: adding intelligence to data captureUnitedHealth targets mid-March to restore Change Healthcare\u2026HTN at HETT North 2024: tackling AI risks and tips for\u20262024/25 GP contract places focus on role of data from\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "SBRI Healthcare awards \u00a34.9m in innovation funding across learning disability and maternity care", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/06/sbri-healthcare-awards-4-9m-in-innovation-funding-across-learning-disability-and-maternity-care/", "content": "\nSBRI Healthcare, in collaboration with partners including the Health Innovation Network, has awarded almost \u00a35 million in funding for innovations across learning disability and maternity care, with five innovations for maternity care receiving a\u00a0portion of \u00a32.5 million and a further five innovations awarded a share of \u00a32.4 million for work in support of autistic people and those with a learning disability.\nThe funding follows initiatives originally launched by SBRI in May 2022, which aimed to identify innovations focusing on a range of priorities including early identification and diagnosis, health inequalities and access to care and access to effective support for people with autism and learning disabilities; and perinatal mental health, post-discharge support and risk identification and stratification for maternity care.

So, the challenge for Trusts is to accurately analyse their current storage costs and compare them to the costs of engaging an offsite storage partner.\nThe second saving is with people, and the cost to manage the processes within Internal Health Records Libraries. Whether to pick, file, scan files, manage the library and records, the costs should be factored in. Also, the costs of ordering stationary, managing staff rotas and time, even cleaning costs, can amount to a higher cost of internal ownership.\nThen there are the efficiency savings. Every time a physical file goes missing or there is a delay in locating the correct record, there is a cost and time implication for the healthcare professionals trying to deliver care to patients in need. Being inefficient can be expensive. In the case of a missing file, you might include the cost of someone\u2019s time to make a replica; the cost of a new file and the stationery required for it; the cost of delays in clinic; and the time lost by a range of employees who cannot do their job until the paperwork arrives.\nRecord optimisation in practice\u00a0\nWith over 890,000 paper-based records filed across different filing systems, County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust (CDDFT) was in need of a centralised digital system through which clinicians could retrieve and transfer medical files at the point of care. The team wanted to see cost savings, standardisation of the records archive, and paperlite operations throughout the trust.\nRestore Records Management put in place a two-step process to help CDDFT. Firstly, an automated ordering system was developed which draws from the trust\u2019s patient administration system in real time, enabling the reduction of physical deliveries and routing requests for scanning, or else stopping the need for physical records all together. The second part of the process involving Restore Records Management specialists working alongside the trust to develop a fully electronic clinical document management system, which ensured that all records were searchable. This led to the development of a database through which records are digitally accessible whenever required.\nThroughout the project, Restore Records Management also provided wrap-around support to the trust, uplifting records where required to alternative premises, helping CDDFT to develop a full understanding of the archive, and implementing a records management system including application of barcoding tech to allow for accurate live tracking.\nThe project at CDDFT has seen records digitised at a rate of 2,000 per day, with 366,000 patient files scanned within the first 12 months. Record retrieval volumes have reduced from an average of 2,000 per day to 42 per day, with savings around staff time, real estate repurposing, labour and internal transportation, as well as a reduction in environmental impact.\nMark Herkes, head of health records at CDDFT, concludes: \u201cRestore Records Management has saved us money and vital space for clinical care. We now have quicker access to patient information providing the patient with a better experience.\u201d\nDriving efficiencies that improve patient care\nSpace for new beds, Restore Records Management estimates the NHS could make space for at least 10,000 much-needed beds in the UK by moving more patient records offsite.\nNo more lost or misplaced files; a solution for loose filing; and an end to note retentions, whereby physical notes are kept in one location when they are required in another. It is estimated that around 25 percent of clinical notes required on a daily basis can be unavailable in this way, posing clear problems for patient care, safety and experience.\nNHS staff often have to wrangle paper files so large that they are almost unmanageable, with years of patient history crammed inside. Restore Records Management actively handles thickness and condition of files to ensure practicality, and digitisation makes it easier still.\nYou can expect to see a speedier process for retrieving patient notes; you can auto generate your file requests; and you can develop clearer working instructions, with Restore Records Management working with trusts to produce agreed business rules and consistent forms to ensure standardisation.\nAs Stefan Chetty, Restore Records Management\u2019s director of public sector, puts it: \u201cBy reducing costs, saving space and increasing efficiency, outsourcing the storage of patient records can achieve that goal \u2013 and pave the way for a smoother digital journey in future.\u201d\nView the white paper here >\nRelatedSBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Norfolk and Waveney ICB among eight organisations joining\u2026North Staffordshire Combined launches patient app with\u2026Research and innovation hub in Bedfordshire, Luton and\u2026Panel discussion: driving patient outcomes through health\u2026North East and North Cumbria ICS pledges to adopt\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Study suggests linking whole genome sequencing and clinical data could help personalise cancer care", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/05/study-suggests-that-linking-whole-genome-sequencing-and-clinical-data-could-help-personalise-cancer-care/", "content": "\nA team of researchers have identified the benefits of\u00a0linking whole genome sequencing data to real-world clinical data, to identify changes in cancer DNA that \u201cmay be relevant for an individual patient\u2019s care\u201d, potentially helping in the delivery of precision cancer care.\nThe study, published in Nature Medicine, saw analysis of data from over 30 types of solid tumour, collected from more than 13,000 patients, with scientists examining genomic data alongside routine clinical data that had been collected from participants over a five-year period.

On the Federated Data Platform (FDP), he stated that pilot adoption sites have shown how \u201cthis type of software can help local teams better prioritise waiting lists, manage theatre capacity and identify their staffing needs\u201d and added that the FDP has helped local health and care teams to understand community health and support personalisation and prevention efforts.\nHe noted that alongside the awarding of the FDP and associated services contract in November, a separate contract has been awarded for privacy enhancing technologies. \u201cFollowing a highly complex procurement, this service will now enter delivery through Q4 and into the 2024/25 financial year and beyond,\u201d the board states, \u201cdelivering significant productivity and other benefits to trusts, building on those seen in the pilot sites.\u201d\nRemaining on the topic of the FDP,\u00a0the board discussed the arrangements in place around data protection and sharing. The impact of individuals opting out of data sharing was discussed, particularly for direct care; the papers note that the board also looked into the current rate of opt outs and discussed planned communication with the public on this topic.\nThe board considered the next steps planned for the transition to and mobilisation of the FDP and its associated services. An independent \u201ccheck and challenge\u201d group has been set up with the purpose of defining, supporting and checking the use cases to be taken forward for the FDP; work is also underway within trusts, integrated care boards and wider regions to drive adoption rates and optimise functionality. In particular, the board considered incentives that could be offered to support adoption rates, and noted that workshops are underway to support this.\nA takeaway from the discussion is that members requested that the focus of NHSE communications on FDP adoption should be drawn more clearly from existing case studies and evidence of benefits from pilot projects.\nPrimary care\nWith regards to the primary care access recovery plan, the launch of the Pharmacy First service \u2013 planned for early 2024 \u2013 was discussed. NHSE\u2019s national director for primary care and community services Amanda Doyle, alongside chief pharmaceutical officer for England David Webb, made a report on this topic; they shared that 9,918 pharmacies had signed up as of mid-January, reported to be over 92 percent of all pharmacies in England. Doyle and Webb shared their confidence that IT system suppliers \u201cwill have the digital infrastructure ready for the Pharmacy First service launch, sharing that investment is being made to \u201csignificantly improve the digital infrastructure connecting general practice and community pharmacy to streamline referrals, increase access to more parts of the GP patient record, and improve how GP records are updated following pharmacy consultations.\u201d\nThey added that their team is working alongside general practice and pharmacy IT system suppliers to update clinical systems in order to support the launch of Pharmacy First, sharing that throughout February, pharmacies are to become \u201cthe first care setting in the NHS to be able to send structured updates into general practice\u201d. These will \u201carrive seamlessly into workflows for review before being automatically filed into the patient record,\u201d the report says, which is expected to save \u201csignificant time\u201d for general practice teams. In addition, suppliers are receiving support to develop capabilities around sending GP referrals directly into community pharmacy workflows; and NHS Pathways is to upgrade the clinical triage system to send electronic referrals from NHS 111 and urgent and emergency care settings to community pharmacy where appropriate.\nAlso on primary care, the board heard from Dr Diwakar how, as of December 2023, 68 percent of practices (599) working with the modernising primary care team have signed contracts with a cloud based telephony supplier, as part of the move from analogue to digital outlined in the primary care access recovery plan.\nLooking at the digital registration service, the board share that 2,249 GP practices are currently using the digital registration service \u2013 exceeding the national target for 2,000 practices to be using the service by December 2023. Additionally, over 640,000 patients have used the service, and practices \u201chave reported increased list sizes\u201d, with data indicating \u201cincreased registrations from patient groups that we traditionally find it difficult to provide services to.\u201d\nDigital records\nOn digitised health and care records, Dr Diwakar shared a number of achievements, including highlighting how \u201cevidence from EPR implementations over the last seven years shows that introducing EPRs led to a 3.5 percentage point reduction in average sepsis mortality for surgical inpatients\u201d. Additionally, he noted that through the urgent and emergency care recovery plan, NHSE has installed digital smart system control systems to support integrated care systems in using data to respond to emerging challenges, to deploy ambulances during surge pressures, to optimise discharge and to identify hospitals in need of extra support.\nThe papers state that NHSE has invested over \u00a3400 million to date to support 150 trusts in implementing, optimising, extending or replacing EPRs, with 189 now having a \u201cmodern\u201d system. Dr Diwakar\u00a0also commented on how the frontline digitisation programme achieved the target for 90 percent of trusts to adopt electronic patient record systems on schedule, previously covered by HTN here.\nOn a related note around data, NHSE highlights how 91 percent of trusts are now submitting data to the Faster Data Flows system, which the board says will \u201creduce the administrative burden on providers by improving the way data is submitted to commissioners.\u201d\nNHS App\nSpeaking on the NHS App, the board heard that 33.6 million adults in England have downloaded the NHS App, with monthly logins rising by 53 percent from 14.8 million users in December 2022 to 25.8 million logins in November 2023.\nThe board states that NHS App messaging is now available for 97 percent of GP practices, with 52 million messages sent via the app in 2023. The NHS also reports that 24 percent of appointments for COVID-19 and flu vaccinations were booked via the app by the end of November, and four millions secondary care appointments were viewed and managed using the NHS App in December 2023, which the papers refer to as \u201capproximately three-fold increase\u201d since the previous December. On future plans, Dr Diwakar commented on a new feature which will allow users to generate a barcode for one-off prescriptions, which can be shown at any pharmacy without the need for a paper prescription.\nResearch and development data\nHere, the board comment that patients are \u201creceiving faster more personalised treatment that meets their needs through the NHS Research Secure Data Environment (SDE) Network\u201d, sharing an example from the London SDE which has approved researchers validate and deploy predictive artificial intelligence models on a large scale.\nAdditionally, the NHS England SDE is \u201cproviding better access to more researchers and life science companies,\u201d the papers note, with eight organisations currently onboarded covering 284 users and 55 research projects.\nThe board calls AI \u201cone of the biggest opportunities to transform care for the better\u201d, and add that 17 AI studies are already underway in the NHS Research SDE Network.\nArtificial intelligence\u00a0\nMoving on to other updates in the area of AI, the board heard how the NHSE England AI Lab, in collaboration with the Department of Health and Education, is working on programmes including the AI in Health and Care Awards, which has awarded over \u00a3123 million to 86 organisations with the aim of developing, trialing and evaluating AI products \u201cmost likely to meet the aims set out in the NHS Long Term Plan\u201d. The AI Lab has also provided funding for several regulatory projects designed to create a \u201crobust and streamlined regulatory system\u201d.\nThere is also the AI Ethics Initiative, which has been set up to support research and practical interventions with the potential to strengthen ethical adoption of AI technologies in healthcare.\nOther work in this area includes supporting the \u00a321 million AI Diagnostic Fund; trialling AI diagnostic support tools for dermatology; implementing the AI Deployment Platform across two imaging networks; and supporting the roll-out of AI across stroke networks, with use of AI decisions support tools rising from five percent in 2019 to a reported 90 percent in August 2023.\nPublic engagement with digital\nOn this topic, the board shares that the #PoweredByNHS data campaign has \u201ccompleted a successful pilot, showcasing the ways that secure use of data transforms research and leads to positive, real-world outcomes\u201d; the figures indicate that one in 10 people in England have viewed at least one of the campaign videos all the way through.\nWhilst there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in favour of public support for specific uses of data, such as direct care, NHSE emphasises that \u201ccontinued dialogue with the public as we take forward specific data programmes and policy changes and programmes is key.\u201d\nThe papers include a reminder that up to \u00a32 million in funding has been allocated for the delivery of \u201clarge-scale deliberative public engagement over 2024 and 2025\u201c.\nNHS Spine\nFinally, the board draws attention to NHS Spine, stating that it is now \u201crunning fully on the cloud\u201d and has seen a 50 percent improvement in performance.\nLooking ahead\nDr Diwakar\u2019s report concludes by pointing out the \u201cfurther opportunity to make the most of the investment into transformed community mental health services\u201d posed by the formation of ICSs, and calls for the role of VCSE organisations to be strengthened as key partners.\nHe adds that NHSE expects to see \u201csignificant expansion in access to transformed models of care\u201d in the final year of the NHS long-term plan, but that transformation must continue beyond 2024 in order to \u201ccontinue to reduce the historical treatment gap\u201d for adults with severe mental illness.\nThe board papers can be found in full here.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Cloud services playing significant role in Microsoft\u2019s reported $62 billion revenue", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/02/01/cloud-services-playing-significant-role-in-microsofts-reported-62-billion-revenue/", "content": "\nMicrosoft has reported an overall revenue of $62.0 billion in the last quarter of 2023, an increase of 18 percent in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year, with Microsoft Cloud revenue contributing more than half of this figure at $33.7 billion \u2013 an increase of 24 percent year-over-year.\nBusiness highlights shared include a revenue increase of 15 percent for Office Commercial products and cloud services; a 21 percent increase for dynamic products and cloud services; and an increase of 20 percent for revenue in Intelligent Cloud, currently sitting at $25.9 billion.\nSpeaking on the results, chairman and chief executive officer\u00a0Satya Nadella comments: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale.

Additionally, the document notes a need to increasingly digitise and automate collection of information along with its management, processing and reporting, as part of efforts to increase efficiency and reduce costs.\nIt goes on to set out ten main ambitions for the region, to be achieved by 2030. These are to implement an integrated intelligence function across NHS and local councils; to extend and optimise community and mental health records; to ensure digital care records for all CQC registered social care providers; to develop a digital inclusion charter unifying how VCS, local authorities and NHS bodies support people; to develop data and digital skills; to ensure secured and connected data infrastructure; and for technical innovation to improve efficiency and outcomes, such as VR headsets enabling delivery of care closer to home. Digital is also to play a role in the delivery of more advanced research methods to help identify people at greater risk, and in a health and inequalities research strategy.\nLooking at ambitions around children\u2019s health, as an immediate action the board commits to the provision of a \u201csafe and anonymous\u201d digital platform for children and young people\u2019s wellbeing, through which they can discuss topics such as anxiety and self-esteem with the aim of sharing experiences and enabling peer support.\nOn the topic of care around ageing, the strategy highlights plans to provide digital support for virtual connection and improved digital skills.\nThe strategy can be accessed in full here.\nLast week, we reported on the news that\u00a0Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West ICB is inviting the public to have their say on its draft primary care strategy via an online survey, with priorities within the strategy including improving patient access, developing proactive and personalised care in the community, and to use data to target need and support prevention.\nIn news from Oxford University Hospitals, the trial of an AI tool let to clinicians\u00a0altering treatment plans for more than 300 patients, and an app called \u2018Let\u2019s Talk Clots\u2019 has been launched with the aim of providing information on how to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot and supporting people in recovery.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "\u00a31.99m contract awarded for technical services to support NHS Digital Staff Passport development", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/31/1-99m-contract-awarded-for-technical-services-to-support-nhs-digital-staff-passport-development/", "content": "\nNHS England has awarded an interim contract with an estimated value of \u00a31,990,000 to SiteKit Applications for technical services to support development of the Digital Staff Passport, with the appointment aiming to bring on board a \u201ccapable and competent supplier\u201d to support with project management, technical application development, development operations, testing and more.\nThe contract with SiteKit, the result of a call-off from a framework agreement, is set to run until the end of August 2024, with NHSE stating that the \u201crationale for this interim contract is that the DSP is not stable enough and we do not have enough detailed requirements ready to go out for mini competition tender for the public beta phase.\u201d\nSiteKit describes itself as delivering \u201cseamless\u201d integrated solutions designed to improve healthcare system efficiency, working with data, digital strategies, software development and application and more.

This system also reduces the radiation exposure to members of our team working in the Cath Lab environment.\nChetan added:\u00a0 \u201cThe quality of diagnostic imaging is exceptionally good at ultra-low doses. It has the capability of 3D rotational angiography providing a good 3D image of the heart and its relations to surrounding structures.\u201d\nE-learning for staff supporting patients with sight loss in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin\nA new e-learning resource for people who engage with individuals with sight loss and who deliver eye care services\u00a0has been introduced in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, as the result of collaboration between people with lived experience, sight loss experts, and professionals from across the country.\nClaire Roberts, local Eye Health Network chair, described how the co-design process involved started conversations with people with sight loss to identify their thoughts on what health and care professionals need to know in order to better support them. It offers two levels of training: the first providing a \u201cbasic understanding\u201d of different conditions and their impacts on people\u2019s lives, and the second providing CPD for clinicians and guidance on where people can be signposted for support in their sight loss journey.\nSwantje Staar-Slogrove from Sight Loss Shropshire commented: \u201cThis training module demonstrates that support for visually impaired people can be uncomplicated and easily accessible. From practical tips to help with technology, mobility or isolation \u2013 help is there. Working in partnership to co-create this learning module has strengthened the link across local sight loss organisations and services and reflects the way we work together.\u201d\nUpdate on virtual wards in Cornwall\nCornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust has released an update on the progress of its virtual wards programme this winter, sharing that capacity has grown to 212 patients with 1,900 patients treated in the last year.\nThe trust estimates that this has saved \u201cmore than 16,500 inpatient days in hospital\u201d, with chief operating officer and GP Tamsyn Anderson commenting: \u201cFrom a mobility perspective, there is a real benefit to being in a familiar environment. Our brains work on pattern recognition. They use a lot of tricks to keep us as independent and mobile as possible. These include something as simple as knowing how many steps it is to the toilet or where the sofa is. When you are admitted to hospital, those props are not available to you. These are among the reasons it is better to try and keep people at home as much as we can.\u201d\nThe trust also shares insight from a user perspective, with a COPD patient stating that she feels that she \u201cgot better at home quicker\u201d.\nRobotic microscope at London North West University Healthcare\u00a0\nA robotic microscope has been introduced at London North West University Healthcare\u2019s Northwick Park Hospital, to be used in procedures designed to restore people\u2019s hearing that would traditionally involve surgeons craning their necks to see inside the ear. It is hoped that use of the robotic microscope can improve comfort and potentially increasing the number of operations that surgeons can perform.\nThe trust shares that an estimated 85 percent of ENT surgeons report musculoskeletal tension from using the microscope for prolonged time.\nThe robotic microscope \u201callows us to achieve an ideal view of the surgical field while ensuring that our necks and backs are comfortable throughout,\u201d says consultant Bhav Patel. \u201cThis enables us to do more operations in a day.\u201d\nVideo relay service for hearing-impaired residents struggling with mental health in Derbyshire\nDerbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has introduced a new video relay service designed to offer support to hearing-impaired Derbyshire residents struggling with mental health. It offers an alternative to the text relay service, meaning residents can now get in touch with BSL interpreters through the Sign Video app or website, who will then connect them with a member of the helpline team.\nEleanor Brett, interim area service manager for Urgent Assessment Services at Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, says: \u201cEveryone has to deal with mental health issues, and this is why it is important that we also support those in our Deaf community to access the mental health helpline service without any barriers, as they are such an important and flourishing community within Derbyshire.\n\u201cOur team of professionals are working hard to find a way to support all communities, which is why we\u2019re pleased that SignVideo have collaborated with us so closely \u2013 so we can jointly help Deaf people to get the support they need, particularly in a crisis.

By the end of 2020, commissioning groups were procuring the majority of solutions and administering them to trusts and providers within a region. The authors note that this resulted in centralisation into unified local care records, supported by a primary technology vendor, \u201cwith increasing availability of hospital record sharing through common data standards\u201d.\nThe latest stage, 2023 onwards, the authors write that there is \u201cexpected unification\u201d of most local care records into consolidated local health and care records exemplars\u201d, which is \u201cexpected to result in complete population coverage over England\u201d.\nOn the impact of data sharing, the authors share that \u201cability to share data from primary to secondary care was associated with lower A&E breach percentage in three tested years\u201d. Additionally, on the impact on patient experiences of emergency care, the authors looked into the NHS national patient survey and comment that data sharing capabilities \u201cdemonstrated significant adjusted association with better patient experiences\u201d. Trusts also reported that \u201cpositive interoperability functionality\u201d was linked with positive patient experience.\nHowever, the study states, no association was found between primary to secondary data sharing and \u201ceither a standardised hospital mortality index, or incidence of patient safety events\u201d. The study suggests that it is possible \u201cthat such mortality indicators, while worth exploring, are too multi-factorial to be considered useful measurements of outcome from broad digital interventions.\u201d\nThe authors then turn to the implications of new regional data sharing agreements which are \u201copening the door to secondary uses\u201d. They highlight a number of implications for healthcare systems reaching this level of interoperability, including the need to focus on system usability and workflow to support providers in achieving uniform impact; that impacts of data sharing interventions \u201cmay be marginal when competing against other, more prosaic determinants of pathway efficiency\u201d; that investment in interoperability will \u201csee the most gains\u201d when building upon resourcing and staffing requirements; that direct interfacing with clinicians can incentivise better quality data entry; and that robust information governance procedures are essential in mitigating increased privacy risk.\nTo read the study in full, please click here.\nCitation: Zhang, J., Ashrafian, H., Delaney, B. et al.

Can you tell us about your current role and background?\nI came CEO for HealthAI in May 2023, but my first life was as a medical doctor trained in infectious diseases. I\u2019ve served in politics as a four-term member of parliament in Portugal, I\u2019ve been a city councillor and deputy mayor of my hometown and I\u2019ve also had an extensive academic career ranging from global health, health politics and digital health.\nIn 2017 I founded a non-governmental organisation which I continue to preside over today \u2013 the UNITE\u00a0Parliamentarians Network for Global Health. It is a network of current and former members of parliaments, congresses and senates from over 105 countries around the world. With the support of the World Health Organisation (WHO), our aim is to work towards science-based, evidence-driven policies for better health for all.\u00a0\nHealthAI: the purpose\u00a0\nWe are a non-profit foundation under Swiss law, based in Geneva. Initially HealthAI was founded in 2019 under the name I-DAIR (International Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence Research Collaborative).\nWhen I came on board, it was clear to everyone on the board and in the team that we needed to rethink our positioning as an organisation. 2019 wasn\u2019t a long time ago, but the world has transformed since then. The pandemic saw acceleration of digital adoption and the widening of digital divides and societal gaps, but it also saw the rise of artificial intelligence from largely a research topic to a mass consumer product.\nIn the face of all of this transformation, HealthAI embarked on an in-depth process to speak to to governments, legislators, scientists, technologists and more, to hear viewpoints and considerations. One word kept coming up \u2013 fear. That fear was relating to AI and machine learning, and it stems from many factors, from lack of understanding of the technology to fear that the technology will take over jobs and human capacity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s fear of the unknown.\nDespite this fear, there is a lot of investment in the AI space for health in particular. But if people are fearful, whether it\u2019s the regulators and policymakers or the citizen, this can lead to a brick wall where people don\u2019t adopt the technology in the long run.\nAll this has fed into the thought process behind what HealthAI\u2019s role is and where we fit in. We\u2019ve designed a model in which we will end up with a global regulatory network for responsible AI in health, ensuring that each country has the tool to validate AI technologies in accordance with international standards. We\u2019re not the ones developing those standards \u2013 that\u2019s the remit of WHO and related organisations, and we have been working with WHO since we were founded.\nOur aim is to make sure that the capacity exists in each country so that each country, with their own sovereign independence, can validate AI tools. We\u2019re working to connect regulatory teams around the world into one global network, to allow sharing of knowledge to help accelerate the validation process safely and tackle any challenges that may arise \u2013 for example, through enabling the sharing of early warning systems to highlight issues or unintended effects. At its core, our work is about helping to ensure safe, quality, equitable and effective AI tools for all citizens when it comes to health; and it\u2019s also about supporting investment and adoption of technology with the potential to improve health outcomes.\nThe potential of AI\nMy role at HealthAI has been a dramatic change of career for me, and that\u2019s because I honestly believe that we now have the technology and computational capacity to embrace AI and machine learning and core related technologies, to actually transform systems and health in particular. We didn\u2019t have that five or 10 years ago.\nHigh-income countries have been pushing for what we call disease-driven models, in which we spend almost all of our resources reacting to diseases. The focus has been on people attending hospital when they are sick and healthcare systems trying to cure them or make them comfortable. But we know that if we address the multiple determinants of health early on and throughout life, in a consistent manner, we can transform that disease-driven model into a system that is focused on health, wellbeing and quality of life. We can lower the burden of disease on society, we can lower the demand on health systems, and we can free up resources to treat the people who inevitably will get sick.\nThe technology needed to do this was non-existent until very recently, and I think AI will play a very important role. We\u2019re already seeing AI being used in many fields, with imaging probably one of the most advanced at this time given the way that it can perform analysis and detection on images. But there\u2019s much more down the road in terms of population health, diagnosis, early detection and warnings, even prevention.\nAI has a key role to play in freeing up time so that clinicians can get back into contact with their patients too. That may seem a contradiction, but I do believe that machine learning can help us re-conquer the compassion and humanisation of healthcare that we have in many ways lost. I read a study from the UK which said that 70 percent of the time, when the patient is in their GP\u2019s office, they are looking at the back of a screen whilst the doctor is typing. We need to get that screen out of the way, we need to get back to face-to-face contact with eye contact, where doctors have the time to do a physical assessment and hold a proper conversation. Every big tech company is investing in what they call virtual scribes, which aim to collect all of the information about an interaction and process it for the electronic health record without the doctor needing to input the data themselves. There are a lot of things like this which I believe over the next few years will become standard.\nThe important thing is that we make sure that it is inclusive, that access is equitable. If we do that from the start \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the advantages of being at the crest of this wave \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to design this right from the start. That\u2019s something we haven\u2019t done with past technologies, and we need to learn our lessons from that. Ultimately, doing this will benefit everyone; because if we have a healthier population, we won\u2019t need as many resources to treat such a high number of patients. Our healthcare workers, who are over-stretched and tired across the board, will have more time to care and will be supported to be more effective in their work.\nThis is the positive angle of what AI can bring to the health system \u2013 we just need to make sure that we mitigate the risks along the way.\nUNITE Parliamentarians Network for Global Health: the role of digital\nAs a network of legislators from over 100 countries, we work with current and former policymakers. We focus on three main pillars: health as a human right, understanding the importance of strengthening health systems, and global health architecture and governance.\nDigital has a presence across these three areas. The first pillar focuses around developing universal health coverage, and that involves trying to ensure access to digital in the most rural parts of the world so that people can use it to access healthcare.\nFor the second pillar, strengthening health systems, the role of digital is critical. As part of this work, UNITE has partnered up with Fondation Botnar (a Swiss philanthropic foundation seeking to improve health and wellbeing for young people across the world, advocating inclusion of young voices, equitable use of digital technologies, and supporting innovative programmes and research). We have created a digital health policy desk which is designed to promote good practices when it comes to policy and promotion of digital health. The initial focus is on several countries including India, Tanzania and Argentina.\nIt\u2019s amazing to see the advancements that can happen just by raising awareness and building capacity. It has led to policymakers truly engaging and understanding that digital needs to be perceived not as purchasing computers and thinking that it will solve the problem, but actually using digital to make the transformation from that disease-driven model to one that focuses on prevention, quality of life and wellbeing.\nKey learnings\nLast year I read a book that really impacted me, called \u2018Power and Progress\u2019 (Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson). It looks at the evolution of technology over the last 1,000 years. The authors point out that every time a new technology has come out, the owners of that tech have said that it would change the world and enable everyone to live a better life. But most of the time, this hasn\u2019t happened. In most cases, the technology has come out and benefitted the few rather than the many.\nThe few times that we have seen technology have a societal impact where even the most marginalised benefit, was when the technology was designed and deployed from the start to be fair, inclusive, equitable and accountable. These are the principles that we now transport into what we call responsible AI.\nTechnology is fascinating. Most of us who work in this space love it. But we need to have a very clear conscience of our history, as humanity, and how we have sometimes failed in the past. We need to make sure that we leave a better world for future generations, and to do that, we need to make sure that technology follows those principles that we call responsible. As well as making sure that they have the impact that they were designed to have, we need to make sure that there are safeguards and mechanisms in place to detect when we fail.\nWhen I got into med school, one of the first things you learn as a medical student is primum non nocere \u2013 first, do no harm. This principle is also applicable to digital health. First, do no harm doesn\u2019t mean avoid risk at all costs. It means mitigate all of the risk that you can and make sure that the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, just like with medicines. With medicines, there are adverse effects that we know about, that we tell patients about when we prescribe them. But we know that the vast majority will benefit from the potential good that the medicine will do, versus the minority who may experience side effects \u2013 and we make that prescription in the knowledge that the potential to benefit outweighs the harm that may occur. We need to use that kind of logic as we design new models for digital.\nAt HealthAI, we\u2019ve been very much inspired by the medicines model. Before technology is deployed into a market, there should be a regulatory process, there should be an authorisation to access that market. It\u2019s in the interest of companies too, because nobody wants to be liable of possible negative consequences of their own technology. If there are mechanisms and clear rules, it becomes easier for the companies to know what they need to comply with and how to get access to new markets. By creating a global regulatory network, we are hoping to learn from the lessons of things that perhaps weren\u2019t done as well as they could have been with medicines regulations.\nDigital health landscape in Portugal\nPortugal is going through a tremendous reform in terms of its health system. We have upcoming elections so we still have to see how that will play out.\nLooking back to the last decade or so, Portugal has been in the forefront in many aspects. Between 2011 and 2014 Portugal imposed a number of regulations which seem trivial now, but at the time they were quite groundbreaking. Electronic prescription of medicines was one; it is essentially the only way to get access to medicines these days in Portugal, and it was critical during the pandemic. There is home care for patients who are still under hospital care but monitored remotely via technology \u2013 we\u2019re seeing those programmes advance a lot at the moment.\nIn terms of interoperability, about 15 years ago Portugal created a platform where every hospital, even if they are using their own electronic health record, can access patient data from a common cloud service.\nThere is some fear that a lot of the money being invested in digital, which is in the hundreds of millions of euros, is being used to update hardware. I would say that is a missed opportunity, if we are not\u00a0able to use that funding, that one-shot opportunity, to make use of digital transformation to go beyond purchasing computers. We don\u2019t just want to transform what we are doing on analogue and make it digital, we should be using that transition to reform and redesign the health system all together.\nWe have our own national health service in Portugal, some great past experience to build on and amazing healthcare workers. I think Portugal has the potential to do many things within its health system, but there needs to be clear vision. Let\u2019s see what comes out of the next election.\nWhat would be the one thing you would do, if you had the opportunity in the Portuguese health system?\nI believe that if you have a role to change things in your health systems, you have to think of it from two levels. One is what we would call your emergency response \u2013 making sure that patients get access to a family doctor and that you reduce the waiting lists that are crippling health systems around the world, with Portugal no exception. For that, you need an emergency programme. But that does not solve structural problems.\nThe first structural thing I think Portugal needs to do is create a health data agency, where all of the health data is collected. It makes your health system much more efficient, because you are capable of following in real time the evolution of what is happening in the health system at the patient level and at the healthcare worker level, and you can perfect the system as you move forward. You can only fix what you measure and what you know.\nAlso, looking at the rise of technologies such as synthetic biology and precision medicine and machine learning, we know that the quality of data is going to be critical to success. It\u2019s a question of being prepared and building that repository.\nAt the same time, if you want to ensure early access to the best treatments for patients in your country, then having a health data agency makes it much easier for clinical trials for example.\nThese are just some examples of how such an approach would put Portugal in the vanguard. Having a national health service of our own is a huge opportunity for change that may not be there 10 years from now. I believe we have what it takes; we just need the right vision and leadership.\nRounding off the interview, Ricardo urged anyone who may be interested in HealthAI to reach out.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s very important that countries come on board \u2013 that anyone who has something to say about this is part of the process from the beginning. We are hoping to see countries validate AI tools from 2025 onwards; we\u2019ll then have a global repository with all of the validated technologies. Hopefully, we can co-create globally and we can put AI to the service of the people. That is only possible if everybody chips in.

As digital transformation lead, he reports to the head of digital programmes, who in turn reports to the chief information officer. \u201cIn terms of the structure of our team, the central tenet of our digital strategy is that ultimately we want everybody to feel part of our digital team,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of our formal clinical leadership structure, we have a CIO but we also have a CCIO, a matron for digital technology, a clinical safety officer who is also a consultant paediatric surgeon, several lead nurses for digital technology, and clinicians with dedicated time built into their job roles.\u201d\nMichelle said: \u201cI\u2019m the clinical director at Solutions 4 Health \u2013 we are a provider of healthcare services, 0-19, sexual health and healthy lifestyle services. We have small team and we\u2019re developing our digital offer at the moment. My background is health visiting and school nursing, primarily, but most recently I\u2019ve had roles in clinical governance and safeguarding in local authority, in NHS, and in the charity sector.\u201d\nWe next moved on to Penny. In her role as CCIO and deputy chief medical officer, she explained that she reports to the chief medical officer; the trust also has a senior responsible officer for the EPR programme in the\u00a0chief financial officer. \u201cOver time, we built a team of two deputy CCIOs, we\u2019ve got a clinical safety officer, and we managed to get dedicated time for senior clinician consultant level in the job plans to support EPR and other digital projects moving forward,\u201d Penny shared. \u201cWe also have representation from the junior doctor team, and support from the chief registrar. I work closely with our chief nursing information officer who has also developed her own team, so we\u2019re working as one big clinical informatics team, and of course our director of ICT and digital who brings the technical and analytics.\u201d\nNext up, Andrew said:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the assistant director of the DDaT function of Bury council, which is a joint role with the Greater Manchester ICB. I\u2019m the IT locality lead for Bury as well. This is my first foray into local government \u2013 my background is in the NHS, I\u2019ve had 17 years in various digital teams, various hospital settings. The structure on the council side is we\u2019ve got a team of around about 45-50, reporting to myself, and then I report in to the director of transformation. On the ICB side, I report to the CIO of the Greater Manchester ICB IT team, and we make up the digital function for the ICB. There are 10 locality leads, and then there\u2019s a wider IT function, and we\u2019re still on both sides of the fence, working through our structures.\u201d\nFinally on introductions, we heard from Kishore.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the co-founder and CEO of Solutions 4 Health. Within the tech, the way we structure this is to ensure that each team has their own focus,\u201d he said, \u201cso we have an extensive tech team, but they\u2019re broken up into specific areas of focus. Michelle and her team are specifically working on addressing challenges within workforce across the NHS, health visiting services, and so forth. We do it in quite distinct pieces of work, and that allows us to put in the appropriate resources, and have leaders who can lead on it without being distracted on what\u2019s happening at a wider level.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the key to building a successful digital team?\nKishore said: \u201cIt\u2019s important to have individuals who deeply understand the challenges within the healthcare sector, as they\u2019re going to be the ones who lead on that product development. This needs to be coupled with individuals with good technical skills, but it has to be driven by people who have a solid understanding of the challenges that exist.\u201d\nPenny shared her view. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to start with them having a great vision of what a digital hospital wants to achieve,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m completely with Kishore about understanding the challenges \u2013 it\u2019s also about where we are planning to go and why we need the digital team. It\u2019s important that the team is valued and sits at board level in the organisation, but we also need to train them well and give them time to do their best work. That means looking at the job plans and incorporating digital within their day-to-day work.\u201d\nTom gave his perspective. \u201cWhen we think of our digital team, we need to think in terms of the wider organisation. One of our organisational aims is to create a brilliant place to work \u2013 part of that is creating a culture where colleagues can thrive, develop, be recognised, and feel safe. To do that, the leadership team has to play their part, modelling the change they want to see, and ensuring there\u2019s multidisciplinary representation on interview panels and on the board, so that decision makers aren\u2019t just people who look and think like me. I agree with Penny, it is about vision and staying true to that.\u201d\nAndrew shared: \u201cThe vision is the key to what you\u2019re doing, because it\u2019s about understanding and aligning people to how you want to work, your team, your culture, and what you want to achieve. Tom talked about diversity \u2013 that\u2019s absolutely huge; we know that diverse teams are more effective, and I think we\u2019ve got great ability in the digital team for neurodiversity and really expanding the workforce so that you\u2019ve got a team representative of the people you support.\u201d\nMichelle shared her thoughts on building a successful digital team, saying: \u201cI think what Tom and Andrew said about service users and really listening to what they want is key. We can build the best team in the world, but if service users don\u2019t want to engage, then they won\u2019t. It\u2019s about listening to how they want their services delivered and how they want that to look, having these focus groups, listening to that feedback, and developing the services in the way that they want.\u201d\nDriving a culture of innovation and change\nWe next asked our panellists to consider how they thought an organisation could go about driving a culture of innovation and change.\nMichelle said: \u201cPersonally speaking, from a health visiting and school nursing background, it really is needed \u2013 we\u2019re in real dire straits as a profession at the moment, so whether we want to or not, we\u2019ve absolutely got to look at different ways of working. From a clinical governance and safeguarding focus, we saw during COVID that there was a spike in safeguarding cases for children. Now we\u2019ve got the option to do things slightly differently; we didn\u2019t have that then, we had to go to a digital-only delivery. I think we absolutely must lead on this and take this forward, because there\u2019s been years of lack of investment in public health nursing services, and we really are in danger of being left behind.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important that innovation is part of our organisational strategy,\u201d noted Penny. \u201cIt\u2019s important that it is reflected in the organisation\u2019s values, and it\u2019s important that we make it easy for innovators to come forward, and also have the right processes in place for people with ideas to support them, bring them in in collaboration with the industry and other providers, and actually make them feel valued.\u201d\nChallenges of building digital teams\n\u201cWhen you go through any kind of restructure and you\u2019re bringing people on a new journey, the challenge is that to unlock the next set of potential, you\u2019ve got to move with the times,\u201d Andrew commented. \u201cBringing people on that journey is always a challenge; some people aren\u2019t ready for it, and the only way you\u2019re going to do that is through good communication, keeping people in the loop and feeling valued as part of that process. Innovation in general in public services implies a certain level of failure, because you need to try things; and there\u2019s almost a zero failure tolerance in services using public money and public time. Part of the integration piece is making sure that everyone is on board; not only your own teams, but get them reaching out into other teams.\u201d\nTom raised the \u201celephant in the room\u201d: funding. \u201cThat is a challenge for everyone,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWith NHS funding it always tends to be time-limited, rather than permanent and recurrent, so we have to apply and bid for funding. Clinical capacity can be challenging, and making sure that it\u2019s baked into people\u2019s jobs is probably one way to address that. There\u2019s change fatigue too \u2013 at Sheffield Children\u2019s there has been an enormous amount of change, just from a digital point of view, never mind everything else. We have a clinical advisory group which meets on a weekly basis which is focused on the development of our EPR. It\u2019s chaired by the CCIO and it leads the change from a patient-facing, end user point of view. There\u2019s got to be a commitment to co-production and design from board to ward, in terms of building quality improvement capability; it takes more time to involve stakeholders from the beginning, but ultimately it\u2019s an investment worth making, because you get a better outcome.\u201d\nKishore noted that whilst COVID led to a leap in progress, the passage of time has led to some progress seemingly reverting backwards with more resistance to change. \u201cThe fear is: are we going to go back to not adopting technology as fast as we could? Clearly, safety is critical and safeguarding is important; but trust in health tech is starting to go back down again, and we must be proactive to understand where the weaknesses are and how fix those.\u201d\nMichelle added a point around digital poverty. \u201cWe are still seeing lots of families not being able to access digital services, so even if we can get the buy-in and the rollout, there are still huge pockets of the population that won\u2019t be able to access it. That\u2019s something that really needs to be addressed before we can properly move on.\u201d\nBuilding strong and diverse digital teams\u00a0\nWe asked our panel for their thoughts on kinds of skills mix required for digital teams, and how they would go about bringing those to the forefront of their own digital transformation.\nTom said:\u00a0 \u201cFor the people who are on the frontline, there is a digital literacy challenge. Getting those people out of their day job, when we\u2019ve got waiting lists and other pressures, is really challenging. When they get training, they\u2019re going to prioritise their clinical skills, understandably, so that\u2019s definitely challenging in terms of what can we do to attract people into digital roles.\u201d\nPenny agreed. \u201cI would see it in two ways: what\u2019s in it for people, what do we offer, what is the value proposition for people to come to join digital; but also, it\u2019s about the soft skills that people can bring. Implementation is really important in digital. We talk about strategy and what we\u2019re going to do, but actually implementation is what\u2019s going to bring an idea to fruition, to the pilot and then to a scale. We need people that can see through the whole journey, who have the skills to do that and the willingness to do that, and we can train them to acquire those skills. For me, digital is all about leadership. It\u2019s about bringing people from different backgrounds and from different disciplines together,\u00a0distributing leadership and giving people the autonomy to drive this.\u201d\nDigital leadership\nWhat are the core skills for digital leadership, and how will those roles develop in the future within health and care organisations?\nPenny started us off on this topic. \u201cWe need leaders who are credible and well-respected, and people who will drive that vision forward and create that important sense of purpose, of why we need to drive digital transformation and what could that look like,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that leaders bring people together through the common vision and the goals moving forward. It\u2019s also important that when we talk about experimentation and autonomy, that we are making sure that people from top-down and bottom-up are very much aligned with what we\u2019re trying to do. We need people to be\u00a0given ownership and the permission to innovate and to fail; because without failure, there is no learning. The best ideas and innovations come out of failure.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about soft skills like coproduction, stakeholder involvement, and then things like understanding procurement and finance,\u201d Tom considered, \u201cbecause that plays a big part in digital solutions and evidence-based decision making. There are just so many projects that are going on at any one time; they really need accountability and governance and we need to make sure we understand the bigger picture. From a leadership point of view, it\u2019s not just the organisation they\u2019re in, it goes beyond that; we need connections at regional and national levels, within frameworks, and we need to develop\u00a0strong networks with other providers.\u201d\nAndrew talked a bit more about the need to recognise capabilities within digital teams, saying: \u201cI think digital leadership is knowing where your strengths and weaknesses are; being cognisant of where you are short. It\u2019s getting quite rare now to get people in senior leadership who\u2019ve got a technical background, but you need to know that you\u2019ve got people around you who can understand the technical landscape.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also trusting the people who you\u2019re with to do their job to the best of their ability, taking a step back and giving them the responsibility and space to develop,\u201d he added. \u201cAgain, let them potentially fail, but put a structure in around them that means if that happens it\u2019s not the end of the world. Board representation of digital is still severely lacking in the NHS, and it\u2019s causing a lot of issues in a lot of places that I\u2019ve seen. Digital ends up becoming a subsidiary of finance or other things, so you\u2019re then bound by someone else\u2019s vision. Digital being represented at board level is absolutely imperative; you cannot run a service well without digital maturity. Having someone who can say when support is required, what we\u2019re going to do and how we are moving forward, is\u00a0really important. I know it\u2019s a touchy subject but something I feel strongly on that we should have representation at board level to to give it the weight it deserves as a function.\u201d\nKishore said: \u201cI think one of the biggest challenges is that technology is moving at such a rapid pace, and every time we switch on the news it\u2019s more innovation around AI. How do you keep your teams at least on an even playing field in an industry where there is so much demand? Getting people with the right skills is phenomenally difficult across all industries, particularly within local authority or the NHS, where we are constrained by budgets. We have to do things on a shoestring budget, and that comes with huge challenges in being able to attract and retain talent. We overcome that by empowering and investing in the team, making sure they don\u2019t fear failure, they want to experiment, they want to learn.\u201d\nFuture challenges and changes\nWe asked our panellists what change or challenge they would like to see tackled on this topic.\n\u201cIt would be great to change the perception of IT and digital, so it\u2019s seen as an enabler rather than an obstacle,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThe Post Office scandal is very topical at the moment, and that\u2019s a stark reminder of when IT systems aren\u2019t implemented well; but I think it\u2019s important that we overcome horror stories like that and show people the potential for good. It\u2019s about getting round that \u2018I don\u2019t like IT\u2019 response that people can have \u2013 they might say that about health tech, but they don\u2019t tend to feel the same about online banking or online shopping. It\u2019s a matter of changing perception.\u201d\nMichelle said that she would like to see more buy-in for digital from a board level, and \u201ca bit more bravery from commissioners being prepared to take a chance on something that actually might revolutionise the healthcare system. There\u2019s a lot of hesitation at the moment. Like Tom said, we\u2019re using it in all other avenues of our lives, and we\u2019re prepared to do our banking online, which is a big thing.\u201d\nAndrew shared his \u201cpotentially controversial\u201d opinion, saying: \u201cI think that the NHS and healthcare need to have a look at the way they structure pay, and at some point separate the clinical and non-clinical pay structures. I think it\u2019s hampering both elements and it doesn\u2019t serve either cohort at the moment. In digital, often we need to hire someone with a specific skill; but you\u2019re going to get nowhere near the market value of that person, because they don\u2019t handle a budget, they don\u2019t manage a team, they don\u2019t do things that you might need them to do as part of a pay structure. Likewise, when they want to look at pay restructure for clinical staff, for the nurses, they have to incorporate everybody who\u2019s on the same grade in non-clinical, which doesn\u2019t make sense either. At some stage, someone needs to look at that and take pragmatic action.\u201d\nKishore agreed. \u201cAndrew\u2019s spot on there,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in Boston a few years ago and everywhere I went there were these massive signs for recruitment, and I was really shocked at the level that people were being recruited at.

NHSE suggests that this data could include information such as overall volume of calls, the time of day that calls are made and health inequalities.\nProviders are urged to develop their understanding of what provision is already in place by undertaking a mapping exercise, designed to understand the services available locally, the hours of operation, capacity and how referrals are made.\n\u201cOnce the current pathway is identified, UCR services and their locally operating QSF-accredited TEC responder services should collaboratively start to develop and implement the referral routes and pathways,\u201d NHSE states.\nThe guidance goes on to provide direction around development of the project team and the pathway itself, as well as implementation guidance and suggestions on training and reviewing the service.\nMoving on to the \u201cgold standard pathways\u201d, NHSE shares an example from Dudley, where non-clinical operators at Dudley Telecare receive alarm calls and then assess and refer to appropriate pathways.

These proposals are that the patient must understand what AI is and how it works; that the possibility of withdrawal of consent at any time must be guaranteed; that it must be defined \u201cin which nodes AI intervention is proposed\u201d with patients choosing whether to accept or reject it; that the role of AI within each node must be identified with breakdown of types of activities performed and level of autonomy in their management; and that the consequences of accepting or rejecting AI at each step are explicit. Additionally, the proposals state that patients should be accompanied during each medical act with explanation over which activities are performed by AI; and that \u201cadequately trained\u201d professionals should assist in drafting and administering consent and explanations of technical procedures, as well as providing assistance \u201cin the case of ethical dilemmas\u201d.\nCitation:\u00a0Sacc\u00e0 R, Turrini R, Ausania F, Turrina S and De Leo D (2024) The m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois of healthcare: the actors in after-AI era under patient consent.\u00a0Front.

Additionally, they add, its proficiency in quickly summarising \u201cvast\u201d amounts of literature can help physicians stay up-to-date with the latest research, and it can contribute personalised treatment plans by considering the data and medical history of individual patients, assisting in \u201ctailoring treatment strategies that account for the unique characteristics of each rare disease case. The authors also argue that ChatGPT and other AI tech \u201cholds promise in disease prediction and early screening\u201d due to its ability to facilitate identification of pre-symptomatic signs of rare disease through analysis of genetic data, biomarkers and clinical information.\nHowever, the authors emphasise the importance of tackling potential bias in training data and add that ChatGPT\u2019s \u201creliance on patterns learned from training data may pose challenges in comprehending the nuanced contextual aspects of individual patient situations.\u201d This underscores the need for human involvement, they add, in order to ensure \u201ca more accurate and empathetic understanding\u201d.\nCitation:\u00a0Zheng Y, Sun X, Feng B, Kang K, Yang Y, Zhao A and Wu Y (2024) Rare and complex diseases in focus: ChatGPT\u2019s role in improving diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0Front.

Through analysis of large datasets, they say, AI can \u201chelp us uncover hidden mechanisms and underpinnings of health disparities\u201d, and is also placed to help \u201cuncover\u00a0 unexpected correlations and relationships that have remained unidentified in human-driven analyses, offering new insights.\u201d\nThe authors note a number of challenges and limitations to AI and go on to\u00a0share six recommendations for leveraging AI to tackle these challenges and address health disparities. Firstly, they write, researchers must advocate for the development and utilisation of more diverse datasets; secondly, \u201cstringent\u201d ethical guidelines and frameworks should be developed for designing AI algorithms. The third recommendation encourages greater diversity within AI research and development teams, with inclusive representation among stakeholders to better equip them to identify bias and disparities. Fourthly, the authors highlight the need to \u201cformulate and implement clear ethical standards specific to AI applications in healthcare\u201d which should focus on reducing bias, ensuring transparency and overseeing responsible development and deployment. The fifth recommendation centres around preserving human-centric healthcare, with the authors noting a need to place emphasis on AI\u2019s \u201ccomplementary\u201d role as a decision-support tool. Finally, they call for continuous oversight and improvement, stating that protocols should be regularly audited and AI systems monitored to ensure that they \u201cremain unbiased, transparent, and aligned to reduce health disparities\u201d.\nCitation:\u00a0Green BL, Murphy A and Robinson E (2024) Accelerating health disparities research with artificial intelligence.\u00a0Front.

The strategy tackles challenges facing primary care including high demand, reduced access to services, ageing populations, and workforce pressures.\nThe new strategy outlines three priorities to help deliver ambitions set out within the ICB\u2019s Integrated Care Strategy and Five-Year Joint Forward Plan, both committed to integrating primary care with community services ICB-wide, and to develop new ways of providing care for patients. The priorities are improving access so patients \u201cget the right support first time\u201d, developing \u201cproactive and personalised care in the community setting\u201d for those with complex health needs, and preventing ill health by \u201cusing and sharing data with our partners about the health needs of local communities\u201d.\nAs part of plans to deliver on these priorities, the strategy sets out intentions to develop services across non-complex same day care through more effective triaging; integrated multi-disciplinary neighbourhood teams; and prevention \u201cwith an initial focus on cardiovascular disease\u201d, tackling common causes of ongoing ill-health and deaths across the ICB leading to heart attack and strokes.\nThe strategy also refers to other areas in which the ICB plans to develop primary care, including promoting the wider use of the NHS app to view medical records, order repeat prescriptions, and manage appointments; providing more training to pharmacists to help them make decisions \u201cwithout the need to involve a GP\u201d; supporting national roll-out of the minor eye conditions service; and exploring the use of mobile dental units to help manage demand.\nOn the plans, Dr Abid Irfan, director of primary care at BOB ICB, said:\u00a0\u201cOur draft strategy outlines solutions to tackle the challenges we face in primary care, including increased demand and the need to improve access with limited resources to support us.\n\u201cOur vision is to transform primary care across Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West by integrating these services and ensure they work more closely with our health and care partners across our communities to provide better patient care. To achieve this we have developed three priorities. To improve access to services so patients with non-emergency needs can get same day care; to ensure those with more complex needs get proactive, personalised care from a dedicated team in local communities; and to prevent people from becoming unwell and staying healthier for longer. In addition, we will need to make better use of digital tools and premises to allow us to work differently. And we need to have measures in place to recruit and retain a skilled workforce.\u201d\nThe public are being invited to offer their feedback and views on the strategy via an online survey, which is open until 29 February 2024. There will also be a region-wide online webinar in February, which will allow members of the public to ask questions about the strategy, with details to be shared in the coming weeks.\nIn related news on primary care, we spoke to Sarah Andersen, GP at Herstmonceux Integrative Health Centre in East Sussex, at the end of last year. Sarah shared with us some of her recent insights and experiences on a range of digital health topics across primary care.\nAs we approached the end of 2023, we also took a look back on the year\u2019s progress and achievements, by asking NHS professionals: reflecting on 2023, what digital projects and programmes are you most proud of?\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026Department of Health and Social Care shares recommendations\u2026NHSE shares update on metrics for urgent and emergency care\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "NHS England \u00a316 million opportunity for \u201cTiger Teams\u201d to support EPR delivery", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/22/nhs-england-16-million-opportunity-for-tiger-teams-to-support-epr-delivery/", "content": "\nNHS England has published a \u00a316 million prior information notice for the provision of \u201cTiger Teams\u201d to support electronic patient record delivery.\nDefined as \u201ca partner to create an experienced, multi-skilled, rapid response intervention service\u201d, it aims to support the Frontline Digitisation programme, enabling healthcare providers to implement an EPR by the end of March 2026.

Delving into the dynamic landscape of community healthcare delivery, and exploring key strategies for a successful transition to a remote-first model, we discussed how by harnessing software and the media types that we use in everyday conversations, we can deliver this approach at scale and across a broad range of community pathways.\nOur expert panellists included Nick Cross, executive medical director at Wirral Community NHS Foundation Trust; Becky Sutton, chief operating officer at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust; Kumbi Kariwo, equality and inclusion project lead at Birmingham Community Health Care FT and chair of the Midlands Digital Shared Decision Making Council for Nurses, Midwives and AHPs; and Peter Hansell, co-founder of Isla.\nInnovation in community healthcare\u00a0\nPeter kicked off the session by offering a brief introduction to Isla, revealing how the motivation behind the company was borne from his personal experience of his father\u2019s MS and the care he received. He said of his father\u2019s care: \u201cHe had a lot of support from acute providers, from primary care, from community care teams right through to social care people who would help him to get showered in the morning and get to work; but what became very clear was that a lot of that was very disconnected, and so really no single person in that process had a very complete understanding of how he was doing. And so we started Isla to address that challenge and to create a dramatically better visibility of patient\u2019s conditions and the way that they\u2019re developing.\u201d\nPeter also talked about the technology involved in Isla and in managing this kind of visibility, considering first how the tech helped with observation and analysis: \u201cWe connect up the inputs and flow of information from a very wide set of stakeholders \u2013 that might be anyone from the patient themselves, family members who are supporting them, the wider community \u2013 \u00a0and then through into community care, acute care and primary care.\n\u201cThere are two real use cases. The first is that we empower clinicians to capture and structure information when they\u2019re delivering care in the home, so that enables community nurses to conveniently capture things like images, video, sound recordings, and complete assessments and so on. We focus on doing that very broadly across the community care organisation, touching most specialties within the organisation, and to enable that we\u2019ve built a web application which you can access through the browser, but which is also available offline so that we have that seamless workflow, even in rural communities. The second use case is enabling and empowering patients to self-manage or self-report on their condition. Patients and the people who support them receive a link via e-mail or SMS, there\u2019s no need to download or install an application, and typically they can complete the submission in less than a minute.\u201d\nOn beginning to join up all of the information from different clinical teams, Peter added: \u201cThat\u2019s where Isla\u2019s platform becomes very powerful, because we can link up that kind of longitudinal view of a patient\u2019s pathway and their condition across their entire care journey \u2013 we can see when the next message is going to go to a patient, when the next visit is scheduled for, if we\u2019re expecting a clinician to capture a set of information updates, where patients are not responding to those links, and we can start to intervene. That gives us a much better single source of truth and a way to understand a patient\u2019s condition. We can start to structure the information, understand patterns in that data, and give clinicians that help with their clinical decision making.\u201d\nMoving on to highlight some of the benefits and use cases of the Isla platform, reinforcing its role in helping support decision-making, improving understanding of conditions, and supporting planning. He noted: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a massive reduction in travel, which saves time and money, and there\u2019s also an opportunity to make sure we\u2019re planning for the right staff to be attending for each visit.\n\u201cIn Nottinghamshire, we\u2019ve been able to connect up that discharge planning process from acute right through into community providers, saving 30 minutes per patient because we have a video-based understanding of the patient\u2019s journey. In wound care, we\u2019ve seen a 75 percent reduction or deescalation of same-day demand \u2013 places like care homes being able to submit photographs of patient\u2019s conditions means that rather than the trust responding by immediately sending somebody out, we\u2019re instead able to review that, give the right advice, the care plan can begin, and we can go ahead with the care visit that was already planned. On financial benefits, typically we see recurrent financial savings of between 250,000 and 400,000 annually; in clinical impact we see a reduction in time taken to get specialist input by 63 percent.\u201d\nUse cases, benefits, and delivering digital change\nPeter handed over to Nick, who talked about his experience of implementing the ISLA platform at Wirral Community NHS FT, saying:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a GP by trade and the executive medical director for Wirral Community Health and Care NHS FT. Research and innovation sits within my executive portfolio, which I\u2019m quite happy about, as it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve got a real interest in.\n\u201cThere are lots of exciting opportunities about how we can disrupt the traditional way of providing care and improve outcomes. Firstly, it\u2019s really helpful if the digital and innovation agenda is woven into all your trust\u2019s organisational strategies, and primarily that demonstrates recognition at the highest level of your organisation, which is crucial when we\u2019re looking at transforming at scale. I\u2019m sure many of you, like me, get loads of emails every week about new shiny products and the benefits that they could bring to your trust, but it\u2019s absolutely not practical to be able to follow up on each of those, so be very clear about what your trust\u2019s strategic and operational priorities are, because that\u2019s going to help you prioritise the areas that you want to focus on if you\u2019re looking for digital solutions. Be really clear from the outset what problem it is you want to solve, because it\u2019s an opportunity to bring people together to seek solutions.\u201d\nNick also discussed the importance of taking a clinically-led and digitally-enabled approach from the beginning, and of getting the right team in place to support the project. On next steps, he shared:\u00a0\u201cThen it\u2019s time to look at options, appraisals, about the potential of running pilots to prove the concept \u2013 is it going to solve the problem, what will be our return on investment? Don\u2019t underestimate the energy that\u2019s going to be needed or the hard work required, because in my experience it\u2019s seldom a smooth journey for something to be embedded.\n\u201cLastly, once you\u2019ve decided on your solution, how are you going to embed it to maximise its use and to get uptake? Again, don\u2019t underestimate the challenges of scaling-up and behavioural change of getting everybody to use it in the same way across a workforce or a large team, and it may be that you need to consider turning something off in order to direct them down that route that you\u2019ve decided is going to create some good results.\u201d\nBecky then took over, to share some of her own experiences from Nottinghamshire, saying: \u201cI work for Nottinghamshire Healthcare Trust as their chief operating officer. A couple of things to add for me \u2013 I think there are some successes around getting the people that deliver the care and the people that receive the care involved early on. We engaged a lot of clinicians on the frontline about Isla, and I think we got some really interesting ideas about innovation by doing that, but I think they ultimately used it in very different ways than we originally thought.\n\u201cWe originally went in thinking it might be able to help with wound care, with the potential to take pictures and share that with our tissue viability teams; but actually some of the things that people identified have been things that we never even thought about, like triaging patient referrals, the stroke pathway, and actually how using those bits of technology can really encourage people on that journey of health improvement by seeing the progress that they\u2019ve made.\n\u201cI think choosing kit that is not disease-specific has always been a real bugbear to me, and actually what you\u2019ve got to look at is which solution is going to help the majority of patients, and can be adaptable, and scaled at pace. Getting those business cases through and being able to articulate the benefits is key.\u201d\nKumbi took the lead on the discussion of inclusivity, equality and accessibility, saying:\u201dI\u2019m a learning disability nurse by background, and more recently I was the first chief of nursing fellow working with our adult teams. I\u2019m based in Birmingham, which is very diverse, and when you look at ethnicity, we\u2019re now a 50/50 city. We\u2019ve also got the youngest population if you\u2019re looking at cities across England, but we\u2019re also starting to get an ageing population, so we\u2019ve got a real mix.\n\u201cAs part of my role we look at the Equality Act 2010, looking at the 9 protected characteristics, and whether our service is fit for purpose. We\u2019ve been looking at what working solutions we can put in place, and we started to look at quality improvement, so what can we do in the immediate future that can impact patient\u2019s lives? We\u2019ve got 87 commonly-spoken languages, so the minute you have an app that has instructions on it, for us we\u2019ve already hit a barrier.\n\u201cWhen we were looking at Isla, we actually looked at 10 providers, and we came up with our must-haves based on our communities, things we needed in terms of functionality. Our first focus was on wound management, but actually we\u2019ve now gone into speech and language therapy, into physiotherapy, and it\u2019s now being used as an MDT tool. When you\u2019re dealing with complex cases, and if English is not a patient\u2019s first language, and you\u2019re asking them to articulate what a wound looks like, a picture speaks a thousand words.\u201d\nMotivation for change and future plans\nWe asked Peter about his insights from his experience with roll-outs across multiple different trusts and organisations, in terms of motivation and drivers for adopting change. He said:\u00a0\u201cI think the big drivers are that the health system is full of solutions and apps, but we are one of the ones that has a very wide breadth of application, so I think that\u2019s crucial for digital teams who are managing the implementation of new technology. The more that you can do with one solution, the better. The NHS probably now more than ever, is hungry for solutions that work, and solutions that you can evidence the impact of. We have an excellent delivery team who work very closely with each of our community partners, and who are writing-in the detail of how much time we\u2019re saving, what that means financially; and that gives us a really strong evidence base.\u201d\nWe next asked Nick to share a little bit about his current community care delivery process, and how he sees this developing in the future. He shared:\u00a0\u201cI think it is generally a very exciting time to be involved in healthcare in its broadest sense, and when we look at AI, when we look at smart devices, smart dressings for wound care, and then start to merge those with the Internet of Things, the options are really endless.\n\u201cI feel that our ability to virtually wrap around people in their own homes in a non-intrusive way is really starting to gain some traction. Integrating a visual care record alongside or within the electronic patient care record, is something that\u2019s particularly exciting for us as a trust, but also access to that longitudinal data, the physiological data linking that with kettles, with toilet flushes, with mobility monitoring in peoples homes, can provide a very detailed picture of health and long-term conditions.\n\u201cFor children and young people\u2019s services, again, so many opportunities for them to remain healthy and active \u2013 linking in with their smartwatch data, linking that into the electronic care record, again providing really powerful data and research opportunities. Automation and AI in clinical decision-making is a huge growth area. There\u2019s already a CQC-approved virtual AI-driven physiotherapy service, for instance, so that can enable the physios to concentrate on the really complex stuff, while other stuff can be managed in a different way.\u201d\nBecky discussed her advice for anyone looking to implement a digital-first model, saying:\u00a0\u201cI think the biggest thing is starting small, but with a big ambition. You\u2019ve got to get people with the passion and the energy \u2013 these things are really hard work, and it\u2019s easy to give up when you get one barrier in the way. It\u2019s easier to start with the people that want to do this, rather than the ones that don\u2019t. You will bring them on board ultimately, so start small, build a team around you that are as passionate as you.\n\u201cThink about how you build that case for change early on, how you can sell the narrative to say, \u201cActually, we can\u2019t recruit all the district nurses in the vacancies we\u2019ve got, so we\u2019re going to use that money a little bit differently\u201d; but you also need that clinical voice, to help you do some of that, because like we\u2019ve already spoken about, people will be worried that we\u2019re replacing them with an IT solution. Actually it\u2019s not, it\u2019s enabling the care, it\u2019s allowing them to do things that we really need them doing, not some of the basic things, and it\u2019s promoting self-care, it\u2019s back to that bigger picture, because if we don\u2019t get people helping themselves, I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to have a workforce big enough.\u201d\nResearch on wound care and future directions\nKumbi shared with us some of the findings from her research on wound care for darker skin tones, saying:\u00a0\u201cTwo years ago, we started looking at darker skin tones. We did a baseline assessment to understand how comfortable and confident our staff were, and what we went on to learn was that traditionally, all skin care was based on white skin tones, and so whilst staff had some understanding on darker skin tones, there was nothing actually set in our training.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give an example \u2013 on my skin you will never see redness, so you\u2019d probably come in and classify me as low risk, but in the meantime, my wound is developing, and then it\u2019s, \u201cOK, Kumbi has a pressure ulcer\u201d. So what we were saying is, at stage 1, 2, 3; you\u2019re probably seeing indicators, but you haven\u2019t been taught them. We\u2019re now starting to learn what those indicators are, and I think when it comes to looking at digital interventions, if your current clinical practice is not right, those mistakes follow on into your digital practice.\n\u201cAI is very much machine learning, and so if you\u2019re teaching it with errors, it\u2019s going to tell you errors. Researchers are saying that within a few years, 90 percent of our workforce will be using digital technology to deliver their roles, so these are the types of conversations we need to have.\n\u201cYou also need data, and so we tend to have a lot of takeaway, or digital solutions where we input data, but actually when it comes to taking it out, it\u2019s very much stuck in the digital ether, so how are we ensuring that the solutions we have allow you to see the data that you\u2019re using?\u201d\n\u201cWe looked at Isla, and one of the things is that you can see the photos on the timeline, so whether there is 1 week or 16 weeks worth of images, it\u2019s very easy to see, compare and justify. One of our cases within tissue viability actually went to a coroner\u2019s court, and the outcome changed because they were actually able to show the images that they\u2019d taken on Isla, and that helped to demonstrate the care that had been delivered.\n\u201cWhat we wanted was a technological solution, where we can start to take images of darker skin tones, because what we realised was that we didn\u2019t have consent for photos, so whilst we had a lot of images, none of them were consented, so we couldn\u2019t use them for training, we couldn\u2019t use them for research. With Isla, one of the things we said from day one was that we need all our photos consented for 3 purposes: clinical purposes, research, and AI. Going forward, patients can opt-in to what level of consent they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now changed our strategy, so now darker skin tone is actually considered a high risk, which means anyone who\u2019s got a darker skin tone within our city now actually has a higher level of scrutiny, because we\u2019re recognising that late diagnosis. It took a learning journey, and now our tissue viability team are champions, so they\u2019re the ones taking it forward. It\u2019s given them the ability to open a dialogue and to work together in changing the care.\u201d\nOur panel then moved on to take questions from our live audience.\nWe\u2019d like to thank our panellists for taking the time to share their insights and experiences.\nRelatedSBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare pilots VR tech to\u2026Cynerio launches enhanced Healthcare Cybersecurity Platform\u2026UnitedHealth targets mid-March to restore Change Healthcare\u2026Royal Devon University Healthcare moves to 'digital by\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "GOSH joins consortium of children\u2019s hospitals to collaborate on decentralised data ecosystem", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/19/gosh-joins-consortium-of-childrens-hospitals-to-collaborate-on-decentralised-data-ecosystem/", "content": "\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) has announced that it is part of a consortium of six leading European children\u2019s hospitals, who will be working together to advance research on children\u2019s health, collaborating on data management to develop new therapies for children and support new technologies such as AI in healthcare for children.\nThe project, titled \u201cPaediatric Hospitals as European drives for multi-party computation and synthetic data generation capabilities across clinical specialities and data types\u201d (PHEMS), aims to create a decentralised data ecosystem, that can \u201cenable the analysis of health data across different hospitals\u201d, whilst still allowing each hospital to maintain authority over their own patient data in line with EU GDPR and national laws.\nOther hospital partners include HUS Helsinki University Hospital in Finland, Erasmus Universitair Medisch Centrum Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Anna Meyer in Italy, Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u in Spain, and B\u0113rnu kl\u012bnisk\u0101universit\u0101tes slimn\u012bca in Latvia.\nUsing \u201cthe technique of synthesising and anonymising data\u201d to provide researchers with access to information without compromising patient confidentiality, the project aims to develop new solutions, along with shared rules and governance structures, which will allow new partners to join and new datasets to be introduced in the future.\nAs part of the project, GOSH is leading the \u201cfirst clinical use case to benchmark the operational management of cardiology patient pathways in four hospitals\u201d, using a standardised data model OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership).\nLaunched in October 2023, the project has received \u20ac7 million in funding from the Horizon Europe programme and the UKRI, and is set to continue to September of 2026.\nKatariina Gehrmann, director of digital and innovation services at HUS New Children\u2019s Hospital, commented:\u00a0\u201cWe will enable European collaboration on health data by aligning ethical and legal requirements of leading European paediatric hospitals with the needs of data users. This ensures that researchers can benefit from rich datasets and advance scientific research in paediatrics while the patient\u2019s rights and data privacy remain protected. One challenge with algorithmically anonymised and synthesised datasets is the lack of evidence on their validity and utility for real-world needs in research or healthcare management. Therefore, we shall perform studies on three clinical use cases and aim to generate evidence in different clinical areas and in the management of healthcare operations.\u201d\nIn other news from GOSH, the hospital has released a report which marks five years since the launch of its Data Research, Innovation and Virtual Environments (DRIVE) unit in 2018, highlighting how the unit has supported more than 300 data research projects over the last five years, and has \u201ccaptured over 100 ideas from GOSH staff and connected innovators across the NHS, life sciences and technology industry and academia\u201d in the last 18 months.\nRelatedNews in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026Feature: overcoming the implementation challenges of the\u2026Interview: \"It's about opening up opportunities to get to\u2026Birmingham and Solihull ICS strategy highlights central role\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Digital-first provider Livi launches \u201call-in-one primary care solution\u201d", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/19/digital-first-provider-livi-launches-all-in-one-primary-care-solution/", "content": "\nDigital-first healthcare provider Livi has announced the launch of a new \u2018virtual practice partner\u2019, described as an \u201call-in-one primary care solution\u201d combining clinical resources and appointment support with digital tools such as a patient app, websites, smart messaging and remote monitoring.\nBryony Henderson, associate medical director at Livi, shares that solution provides practices with \u201cpractical and scalable digital services that can flex to meet the practice\u2019s needs\u201d, with its ultimate goal \u201cto help practices impact and manage peak demand effectively\u201d.\nAlong with secure messaging services, the virtual practice partner is said to provide insights and reporting, and will work with core systems such as EMIS and SystmOne.

Patients use Flow in their own homes for 30 minutes five times per week over a three-week period, with that number either reducing or coming to an end as time goes on depending on the patient\u2019s needs.\nPatients with a diagnosis of depression are being offered the treatment from the community mental health teams, specialist perinatal mental health services and maternal loss psychology services, and researchers note that the treatment has \u201cseen significant improvements on measures of depression severity, meaningful activity functioning, and quality of life\u201d.\nWill McIlhiney, community mental health practitioner, said:\u00a0\u201cBeing able to offer Flow has been very well received from our patient group. One of the common themes I notice when I discuss Flow with a patient is that people feel optimistic that there are other options for them when they have not recovered with anti-depressants alone or found them intolerable. Many of our patients are interested in an intervention which is not a medication or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The choice is very valuable to them.\u201d\nHe added that patients have \u201cgenerally reported positive outcomes\u201d and although the treatment option will not suit everyone, there has been \u201csignificantly less concern about side effects than when exploring other traditional medication options. The convenience of using the device is also well regarded when compared to other options.\u201d\nFor practitioners, Will said, Flow\u2019s clinical portal through which engagement with the treatment can be noted is \u201cso incredibly useful. Being able to monitor usage as well as regularly updated psychometric scoring really helps monitor patients.

The authors indicated that this stress could lead to a loss of motivation and receptivity toward training.\nPerceived training needs identified by the study included technical skills around the use of remote technology; communication and clinical skills using remote technology; implementation skills relating to the embedding of remote encounters, and pedagogical skills on how to train staff or patients. Staff often felt they had quickly developed skills and confidence after being \u201cthrown in the deep end\u201d, or that they knew how to use the technologies but not confidently or at the required pace.\nOn participants\u2019 experiences of training, the study found that provision \u201cvaried considerably\u201d across its sample of 11 general practices, with some offering formal training linked with locality-wide digital capacity-building initiatives; some having no dedicated time for training; and some senior or digitally-confident staff taking on the responsibility for training others as digital champions or super users.

Current training was found to be \u201cdidactic and focused on particular digital technologies\u201d, with participants valuing didactic training to acquire basic competence, but feeling that their capability and confidence around complex decision-making was generally acquired through experience, informal conversation and on-the-job methods such as shadowing.\nThe authors\u2019 concluding remarks were that \u201cthe distributed nature of remote and digital work mean that team training and system learning must be part of the overall training strategy\u201d, and that \u201ctraining programmes and policies need to reflect these important pedagogical insights\u201d.\nCitation: Trisha Greenhalgh, Rebecca Payne, Nina Hemmings, Helen Leach, Isabel Hanson, Anwar Khan, Lisa Miller, Emma Ladds, Aileen Clarke, Sara E Shaw, Francesca Dakin, Sietse Wieringa, Sarah Rybczynska-Bunt, Stuart D Faulkner, Richard Byng, Asli Kalin, Lucy Moore, Joseph Wherton, Laiba Husain and Rebecca Rosen.

Having started her NHS career as a podiatrist she completed the NHS Management Training Scheme in 2000 before working in commissioning and provider organisations at board level. Eleanor then embarked on a healthcare consultancy career with 10 years at EY, and joined Channel 3 in 2007, where she has led ambitious, transformational digital programmes.\n\n\nWith over 17 years of experience as an NHS physiotherapist, Chris brings a wealth of clinical expertise and insight into healthcare technology implementation. As a lead reviewer for regulator NICE he helped shape national guidelines and recommendations that have impacted patient care across the UK.\u00a0Chris also was part of the clinical informatics leadership team for the EPR implementation at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and was selected as one of the first Topol Fellows at NHS England, a prestigious role focused on driving advances in digital health. Chris\u2019 deep NHS background combined with his passion for improving care through technology make him a transformational leader.\n\n\nIn the face of funding challenges, how should organisations be spending their digital pound?\n\n\nEleanor: We are in an unsustainable position across health and care services \u2013 demand is increasing and there are not enough staff or enough money to respond. Digital is a big part of the way forward, but the significant investment in digital to date has not yet had the impact it should.\n\n\nDigital provides \u00a0the opportunity for health and care services to work differently, benefitting patients, staff and taxpayers, and a lot of that can come from getting value out of investments that have already been made. As a rule of thumb, financially you need to expect at least \u00a33 return on investment for that digital pound. You deliver that by focusing on how the system is used to deliver better ways of working and caring, not just on getting the tech right. Digital transformation is ultimately about cultural change.\n\n\nChris: When times are hard, the health and social care organisations across an integrated care system \u2013 ICS \u2013 often don\u2019t consider digital a priority, when really it should be seen as core investment to deliver tangible benefits.\n\n\nWe spend a lot of time with organisations on their business case. They often take a narrow view of potential benefits, limiting expected gains to those directly related to the specific solution. But the reality is that digital technologies provide value far beyond their immediate use case. Their integration unlocks adjacent opportunities across operations, creating a ripple effect of efficiencies and improvements to deliver enterprise-wide impact.\n\n\nEleanor: \u00a0The environment is going to become even more politically challenging over the next 12-18 months with an election looming and money tighter than ever, so delivering value through digital shouldn\u2019t be optional. As taxpayers, we need our NHS to be embracing digital to improve our experiences and outcomes as patients, and as a critical enabler in delivering cost-efficient, productive healthcare services.\n\n\nChris:\u00a0There is a lot of talk about the impact that AI will have on medicine, but it depends on getting the basics right \u2013 having electronic patient record (EPR) systems in place, producing consistent, standardised data that is analysed and used, having clinicians with the skills and confidence to work with AI-powered technology and having the expertise to rebuild patient care around digital tools and information. Throwing expensive tech at problems will not work unless all the foundations are in place, and hospitals and clinics might already have a technology that could help. It is easy to spend digital money poorly.\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0We\u2019ve got to remove legacy systems, too. If you look at banking and travel, when they introduced digital services they started to phase out access in the high street. If they had continued they\u2019d be running two services in parallel and increasing costs. To move people towards the digital solution, you have to change the model and remove the legacy processes.\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of digital investment in healthcare?\n\n\nEleanor: When digital solutions are implemented well they improve patient safety, clinical outcomes, patient experience, workforce productivity and job satisfaction. They also drive further improvement as the data generated can identify further areas where ways of working can be optimised.\n\n\nTake EPRs as an example. The work we\u2019re doing with a client across two NHS hospitals forecasts cash-releasing benefits of up to \u00a330 million over 10 years. There are non-cash-releasing benefits alongside that through things like reduction in length-of-stay and saving clinician time, which we estimate at \u00a370 million.\n\n\nDigital unquestionably saves lives. It might be through real-time monitoring of a patient on a ward to identify signs of deterioration, such as sepsis, or monitoring a patient in their own home, enabling them to be safely discharged from hospital while still being supported.\n\n\nIt is also the key requirement for integrating services, such as hospitals, primary care and social care.\n\n\nHow do we have to approach service design to enable organisations and systems to derive these benefits?\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0To drive these benefits, the impacts on workforce and estates cannot be underestimated. That\u2019s where the financial and operational efficiencies will be delivered. Implementing digital well and transforming care will involve the workforce working in an entirely different way, so there\u2019s going to be an impact on training, roles and responsibilities.\n\n\nTaking virtual care as an example. In a traditional setting, community nurses visit patients in their homes. Now that same nurse can look after a few hundred patients from looking at data on a dashboard. They can still make visits, but by viewing the data and making phone calls to assess need they will be visiting fewer patients and focusing their efforts on those with more complex and urgent needs. That is not how that nurse will have been trained.\n\n\nI think digital will also help with recruitment and retention of nurses. We have lots of people who are leaving the NHS because of low job satisfaction. I believe digital is well-placed to help us hold onto the workforce, because we can provide a different working experience and work life balance by reducing admin and repetition and freeing up more time to care.\n\n\nFrom an estates\u2019 perspective, we\u2019re used to outpatient suites with banks of chairs where people have to sit and wait their turn. With use of video \u2013 and indeed telephone \u2013 as well as remote monitoring of body functions with tech such as wearables, the need for outpatient visits is drastically reduced. This saves patient and clinician time and allows buildings to be repurposed.\n\n\nThere are the clinical benefits too. I was a diabetes specialist podiatrist \u2013 I used to ask my patients how they were getting on with monitoring their diabetes and often they weren\u2019t monitoring it very well, if at all. Now, with digital tools, I\u2019d be able to see it all, and more importantly so would the patient. They would know exactly what behaviours affected their feet. This reduces the risk of amputations.\n\n\nChris:\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting that the financial, clinical and operational benefits are interweaved, not separate. For example, workforce benefits are directly related to costs associated with reducing spending with staff agencies, or enabling people to make better use of their full range of skills.\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0When we meet organisations, we often hear that the technology has been implemented but it\u2019s become more of a chore or a barrier than a help. Something that used to take two minutes now takes 10 because of the way the system is configured or because the processes around it haven\u2019t been redesigned. That\u2019s the bit we focus on \u2013 redesigning the system to ensure the technology benefits patients and staff.\n\n\nHow should organisations tackle the management of risk with these types of programmes?\n\n\nChris: Health and social care have a lot of complexity, and therefore risk. This means preparation is essential. For example, implementing an EPR means intensive testing before go-live, a massive training programme and lots of communicating with staff and patients. We make sure that the staff who will be using the system are involved at every stage \u2013 they are the ones who know how the tech will be used in busy departments when staff are under pressure, so their insights about how to prepare and run the system are gold dust. You have to listen and act on what you learn \u2013 that is how these big systems can be introduced safely.\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0Having a service model that isn\u2019t digitally enabled carries risks in itself. It\u2019s not like you are moving from a risk-free environment into a risky environment by becoming digital. On the contrary, good digital systems will greatly enhance patient safety long-term.\n\n\nWho do you think holds the responsibility for driving the value out of successful digital transformation?\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0I feel passionately about the fact that digital is everybody\u2019s responsibility, from ward to board. When we talk to organisations, we often find that people will point you to the CIO, but they can\u2019t do it all in isolation. It has to be aligned with other aspects such as clinical, workforce, estates. People should be expecting to be working in a digitally-enabled environment, and to be cared for in a digitally-enabled environment too.\n\n\nHow do ICSs and organisations drive more from digital?\n\n\nEleanor:\u00a0First, understand what you\u2019ve got. Do some baselining to see what investment you\u2019ve already made and whether it has delivered what you wanted. This will identify duplication, waste and inefficiencies, which is a great place to start.\n\n\nThen you need to look at how well you are using what you\u2019ve got. Is there more that you can and should be achieving from the investment you have already made? How can you join things up to have an even bigger impact?\n\n\nFrom there, you need to think about your future investment strategy. What else do you really need? It might be that by investing in something slightly different, you can rationalise the technology that you\u2019ve already got. It\u2019s about making wise investments.\n\n\nChris: You need to spend time and money with the people on the ground on how you implement solutions. That includes the patients. Having that user-led, clinically-led design is what delivers impact and outcomes.\n\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "HTN Now: Panel on digital transformation, successes, challenges and learnings\u2026", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/12/htn-now-panel-on-digital-transformation-successes-challenges-and-learnings/", "content": "\nFor our latest HTN Now thought leadership panel discussion, we were joined by Rob Birkett, CDIO at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust; Dr Paul Wright, GP and deputy clinical director/IT clinical lead at NHS Greater Manchester and CCIO at Manchester and Trafford Local Care Organisation; and Graham Etherington, Solutions Director at Kodak Alaris.\nWe began by asking our panellists to share some of the digital transformation programmes they were working on at the moment.\nPaul kicked off the introductions, saying:\u00a0\u201cI work as a GP in South Manchester, and then work with the locality team in my role at NHS Greater Manchester, and with the local care organisation, who provide community services and work with the local trust.\n\u201cFrom a general practice perspective, the digital focus is aligned to the modern general practice model and all the work that\u2019s going on in terms of recovery and transformation in that new model of of care, and I think one of the things central to that is agile working and digital enablement. Our practice is involved in two pieces of work that we\u2019re particularly excited about at the moment \u2013 one is a research project called Progress, which is looking at the role of genomics and using pharmacogenetics to drive decisions around prescribing. Another is called ID LIVER, which is looking at how we use data that we hold around people\u2019s different characteristics, risk scores, and how we can work with secondary care to better manage people at risk of developing liver disease.\n\u201cAt a community level, we\u2019ve got Hospital at Home and the community EPR. In secondary care with MFT, they\u2019ve gone live with Epic, so that EPR implementation. I feel like we\u2019re stood on the edge of a continued wave of transformation that we\u2019re going to see over the years ahead as we implement and follow what was outlined in the Topol Review.\u201d\nGraham provided an overview of how Kodak Alaris supports healthcare organisations: \u201cAt Kodak Alaris, we work with many healthcare organisations, looking at digital transformation in various guises across the NHS. We\u2019ve been working with NHS Trusts for over 3 decades now, capturing and managing data, and making sure that data is accurate. We\u2019re now guiding and working with trusts to do what they do best, and that\u2019s working with people and helping people. We\u2019re making sure their data is correct when they go into the patient records, and when they need to go through the system. We have many case studies that we\u2019re working on relating to transformation programmes such as what Paul and Rob are working on now.\u201d\nWe moved on to Rob, who summarised some of the digital programmes at Calderdale and Huddersfield:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m CDIO at CHFT, which hosts the Health Informatics Service, which is a shared service across primary care, across a number of our system partners. In terms of our transformation programme, it\u2019s been ongoing since 2015, and it started off with a tactical programme that looked at replacing a lot of our older systems, which preceded a \u201cbig bang\u201d EPR go-live. We tried a couple of times at landing big optimisation programmes off the back of that go-live, but due to the costs and financial pressures across the system, they never really got off the ground. So what we\u2019ve done instead is we\u2019ve broken that down into smaller pieces, and we\u2019ve looked at things that have caused us issues within the trust, and how we can take the solid digital foundation we\u2019ve got to make improvements.\u201d\nKey learnings on digital transformation\nWe asked our panellists what stood out for them in terms of what had worked well for digital programmes they were working on at the moment.\nPaul noted: \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be part of the NHS England digital leadership programme, and we spent a lot of our Christmas looking at the keys to transformation and change. It was really beneficial to spend that time to reflect on what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it. Yesterday, we were looking at the outpatient transformation programme, and following the Epic implementation, there were departments that had been feeling a greater challenge in terms of the use of the software, whether it was around the software design or the processes, the training. The team had engaged actively with that department, identified the issues that were being felt, and then through a process of quality improvement, worked with the team to support them to move forward. The outcome was a 20 or 30 percent improvement in productivity. Having that that leadership and culture is important, whereby there\u2019s that active reflection on where we are and how we\u2019re performing.\u201d\nA remit to Paul\u2019s work focuses on the primary-secondary care interface \u2013 we asked how can progress be achieved in this area and how can progress be measured?\nPaul said:\u00a0\u201cI think that\u2019s the key question \u2013 what does success look like? I think if we\u2019ve not defined that from the outset, then we\u2019re destined to fail. Although there\u2019s ambitions set around the primary-secondary care interface, to me it means something that\u2019s been borne out of the experience of the Epic implementation. And what we learned through that implementation is that it really shows you where the interfaces are, because where there are issues is where there are handovers of patient care, where the primary and secondary care systems meet, where the community and secondary care systems meet. The way I\u2019m encouraging us to look at what success looks like, is to use the quadruple aim, so that we are thinking about patient outcomes, efficiency, workforce \u2013 because you certainly know when you\u2019ve got it wrong. We\u2019ve got a really active Teams chat with our GPs in Manchester, and that\u2019s been really helpful to understand where we\u2019re missing the mark. And I guess, when you don\u2019t feel it, then it\u2019s working well \u2013 when people aren\u2019t upset by things like the content of discharge summaries, when people are getting information they need, where patient care is moving seamlessly between systems, and people don\u2019t feel the gap between primary, secondary and community care.\u201d\nGraham also answered this question, saying: \u201cI\u2019d like to echo something that Paul said, and it\u2019s about mindset and people changing. I think what we\u2019re finding now is that people are open to taking on new ideas, especially with promoting agile working, because a lot of people now work remotely and can do their job from home. We\u2019re doing a lot of work for the medical records management department, where we must make sure that their data is correct, and there\u2019s two areas that we look at \u2013 the forward scanning and the back scanning. It\u2019s also about engaging with the NHS Trust \u2013 it\u2019s about having those conversations and guiding them to relieve some other pressures that they have at the back office that nobody sees, to take away that pain of manually extracting documents and manually checking documents, and improve that patient records system. We\u2019re looking at how they do their quality audits and making sure that, as they\u2019ve moved forward, they get the right information from the right patient. I think we find it encouraging that people want to engage on this now, and I think managing data and understanding that data is the key to success.\u201d\nRob added his experience from Calderdale and Huddersfield, saying:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve done things like special builds within the EPR for same day emergency care; we\u2019ve made our controlled drug register electronic; we\u2019ve just procured a new patient portal, and we\u2019ve gone through a whole transformation programme around nursing documentation, which has a number of knock-on benefits around data quality, reshaping pathways, etc. In terms of what worked well, that real close relationship with clinical and operational colleagues, understanding what the organisation and its patients need, and then also breaking it down into manageable chunks that can be funded with some clear benefit.\u201d\nOvercoming challenges\nWe moved the conversation on to talk about some of the challenges that our panellists had experienced over the last year, and what steps they had taken to overcome them.\nGraham started the discussion, saying:\u00a0\u201cI think one of the major challenges we have is how the trusts are budgeted. When you talk to a trust and it\u2019s halfway through the year, even though you have solutions to help them solve problems, you have to wait until budgets are reallocated to start to put them in place. It\u2019s maintaining appetite and the difficulties getting things implemented within a reasonable timescale.\u201d\nPaul agreed, saying:\u00a0\u201cDefinitely the time frame around funding is something that does leap out. I think it\u2019s really interesting seeing the difference between trying to implement change in general practice versus implementing change in the trust, because in the trust there\u2019s recognition of the need for clinical digital leadership, the development of CIO\u2019s, implementation of the EPR; and we\u2019re working in an environment where although its vast and the change is complicated, it\u2019s in a controlled environment where there\u2019s a clear organisational structure, and a top-down, bottom-up implementation can work.\n\u201cIf you think about trying to deliver change in general practice, we\u2019re working with colleagues who operate in their own individual business units and then practices and PCNs, so we\u2019ve got multi-layered complexity, and ultimately from a locality perspective, it\u2019s not our place to control general practice. We\u2019re working on the shoulder of, and in partnership with, general practice, to support that change.\n\u201cThe workforce that supports that has a real challenge in terms of developing that shared vision, the culture, supporting the training and the communication, and if the funding is time-bound, then how do we develop and retain those skills when we\u2019re only ever offering people 12 months of employment? We\u2019ve got great people in Manchester, and I want to keep them there, but to do that we need to be able to to offer the positions or attract people in and then be able to lock them in. We\u2019ve got locality, ICB and national priorities, and we\u2019ve got this challenge of overlapping strategies. The ICB ambition is to have primary care, community care, secondary care, and social care working together, and yet those organisations independently are setting their own priorities, so there is a real challenge around how funding works across those domains and how some of the facilitating work that needs to happen, happens in a joined-up way.\u201d\nRob added:\u00a0\u201cI talk to colleagues regionally and nationally, and recruitment\u2019s always difficult. We\u2019ve got good retention across the organisation \u2013 both digital and across other roles \u2013 but recruitment in specialist roles is always difficult. I think finding the right skills can be difficult, but we\u2019ve done a lot in terms of growing our own, and looking at how the organisation invests in its people. When we say we want to develop people into roles, we get the backing of the trust to do that, and we\u2019re always on the lookout for talent, whether that\u2019s internally or across the region. If we\u2019re going to deliver EPR optimisation over the next five years, we need to put a lot of time and effort into building a team that\u2019s cohesive, that will get on well, that\u2019s got the right set of skills.\n\u201cFinding the right partners is difficult sometimes. There\u2019s a lot out there that can promise to do a lot of things, but I think what\u2019s helped us is we\u2019ve always looked at long-term, so we\u2019ve not tried to get any quick wins. We\u2019ve tried to build those relationships, and suppliers aren\u2019t charities, they\u2019re not doing it for free, but there\u2019s definitely joint wins in there. I think finally is funding \u2013 are we going to get funding at the minute for a big digital optimisation programme? Probably not. But if I look back over the last 12 to 18 months, we\u2019ve probably achieved the same as we would have done through that programme, but we\u2019ve just done it in smaller chunks.\u201d\nWhat does \u201cgood\u201d look like for digital\u00a0transformation?\nWe asked our panellists what they thought \u201cgood\u201d looked like for digital transformation, and what some of the key elements were for success.\nGraham said: \u201cFrom a Kodak Alaris point of view, where we can implement department assessment quite quickly, without having to go to a very large strategy meeting, because once it goes up to the large strategy meeting, it gets lost in the bigger picture, and then has to go to budget and planning. One of the areas what \u201cgood\u201d looks like is where we supply and we create that kind of workflow, that helps the NHS Trust, making sure that the back office is working correctly, or where automation can come in and help this. We try and streamline everything that we put in, to make sure it promotes agile working, and to make sure we make performance improvements so the funding can go to where it\u2019s really needed. Then we find that the waiting lists come down, because it\u2019s more agile.\u201d\nPaul also responded, saying:\u00a0\u201cA good patient experience, where patients and staff would reflect positively on the experience, and then we would be able to identify the population health benefits of the work that we\u2019re doing. I think as you get into a project or programme-specific piece of work, you then get into what the ambitions are, what the targets are, and the measurables that you\u2019ve set yourself. \u201cGood\u201d would look like having the clarity of that and being able to evidence the work done in the learning from that piece of work, within that framework. The NHS change model is a really good way of looking at delivering transformation, and that sort of self-scrutiny is key.\u201d\nPlans for the next 12 months\nWe asked our panellists about their plans for the future, and what the next 12 months looks like for them.\nPaul began by saying:\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a really progressive year for general practice. There\u2019s lots of work going on around cloud telephony and the recovery programme. We\u2019ve got the GP improvement programme, which will see continued efforts around the improvement of the delivery of that model of care. So that\u2019s getting back to how we implement that and support data at locality level.\n\u201cThen seeing trusts move to an EPR, which puts them into a new place in terms of the ability to support system integration, because now we\u2019ve got robust clinically-coded data sat in secondary care, around that patient\u2019s care journey, and what that means in terms of improving the quality of communication between primary and secondary care. We\u2019re just on the fringes of that, so I think we\u2019ll see more of that interoperability and data exchange, which in turn will enable the automation of other things. I\u2019m excited by the Progress work, the pharmacogenomics, and hoping that we see those results being embedded into the primary care system, driving the clinical decision support software. We\u2019re stood on the edge of a really exciting time, where the opportunities are substantial, and I was reading back through the Topol review just before this conversation, and it all just resonates with where we are at the moment, so what I would expect is for a lot of those things that have been proposed to to become reality and part of everyday practice.\u201d\nRob answered:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve procured a patient portal, and got some really tight timelines to get that in, in the first quarter of 2024, so that\u2019s going to be a big one. Then we\u2019re working towards our HIMSS standards \u2013 we put eprescribing in a number of years ago and we did a whole Scan4Safety programme, but we\u2019re looking at how we can now scan dosage at the bedside in relation to the patient, so that\u2019s going to be big for this year.\n\u201cContinuing with relationship building, we\u2019ve just done a joint initiative with Huddersfield University around digital nursing, and we\u2019re looking to continue that this year. There seems to be a disconnect between what they\u2019re learning in university, digitally, on a nursing degree, and what they see when they come to work in the hospital, so we put together a programme where those nursing students come into the hospital and spend 2 weeks looking at all those digital aspects of social care.\u201d\nFinally, Graham talked about plans for Kodak Alaris over the next 12 months, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve been developing our data product, which is called KODAK Info Input Solution, and we\u2019re wanting to bring everything together into one shared platform. We\u2019re working with the trust to bring that data together, where you can have information coming from a physical document, a PDF, or an electronic document, and we can pass it through to the care systems, or the EPR systems, within one platform, making it a really seamless process that will bring a lot of advantages. It means one platform and one supplier, which brings what we would call a return on investment quite quickly. And instead of being over five years or three years, it can be a 12-to-18-month period, which helps with what we spoke about earlier with budgeting. We\u2019re making sure that every piece of information and data they get is correct and accurate, to bring that performance and productivity to the front end, whilst really looking after the patients. We\u2019re hoping to bring the awareness to our partners in the NHS Trusts we\u2019ve been working with for over 3 decades on data capture and data management, that we\u2019re here to help, we\u2019re here to guide, and we can help with data transformation, especially in the one-platform scenario.\u201d\nOur panel then moved on to take questions from our live audience.\nWe\u2019d like to extend our thanks to our panel for taking the time to share their valuable insights with us and our audience at HTN.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Clatterbridge Cancer Centre launches new digital strategy emphasising digital foundations, patient and staff empowerment, and better use of data", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/11/clatterbridge-cancer-centre-launches-new-digital-strategy-emphasising-digital-foundations-patient-and-staff-empowerment-and-better-use-of-data/", "content": "\nThe Clatterbridge Cancer Centre has launched a new digital strategy, emphasising digital foundations, patient and staff empowerment, and better use of data.\nWith the overarching digital mission to \u201charness the power of digital technology and data to transform care, improving patient outcomes and experience\u201d; the strategy identifies four themes: digitally transforming cancer services, empowering cancer patients and carers, empowering staff, and advancing data-driven cancer research and innovation.\nOn digitally transforming cancer services, the plan sets out a roadmap to 2025, with steps including a clinical system optimisation programme, robotic process automation for pharmacy, a digital command centre, the expansion of the shared care record, primary care ecomms, and digital drugs management and workforce. From these actions, the trust expects to see benefits such as the real-time overview of operational data, real-time test results, enhanced collaboration around diagnosis and imaging, and improved care coordination and support across cancer and GP services.\nIn terms of empowering cancer patients and carers, the plan\u2019s roadmap covers actions including Care@Home telemedicine and remote consultations, improving digital inclusion, virtual reality experience, a patient empowerment portal, and a virtual ward. Anticipated benefits are improved access to care, helping patients get home faster, improved patient communication with care teams, and enhanced acute care in people\u2019s homes.\nThe roadmap to empowering staff covers RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) asset tracking, Tap&Go expansion, digital training on demand portal, DigiFlow, VR training, regional diagnostics network, and a digital champion team. These steps could mean that staff can track equipment with a high level of accuracy, that staff can tap in and out easily without losing unsaved work, that staff have the digital training they need, and that clinicians will have a faster and more reliable experience when accessing regional medical images.\nFinally, on data-driven cancer research and innovation, the roadmap covers phases including an advanced analytics pilot for the lung cancer pathway, AI for diagnostics, improved use of dashboards and data assets, an advanced analytics platform, secure data environments, and a digital network refresh. Benefits from these steps could include better insights to advance treatment of patients with lung cancer, and better operational planning and decision making.\nThe strategy moves on to discuss digital foundations, noting improvements to be made across security, connectivity, devices, process, service, and platform. Actions under this header include continuing to build on the trust\u2019s Cyber Essentials Plus and Data Security and Protection Toolkit accreditation; working with regional cyber security and emergency preparedness, resilience and response groups to respond to threats effectively; improving network speeds and resilience; adopting the latest operating systems to ensure ongoing digital asset support; maturing processes around technical infrastructure; building a digital command centre to better respond to digital and data needs; and moving to a cloud-first model by 2024.\nTo read the strategy in full, please click here.\nAlso from Clatterbridge, the trust has announced its role as one of the eight early adopter sites of the NHS\u2019s new National Competency Framework (NCF) for the recruitment and development of data professionals, designed to \u201cprofessionalise the data and analytics workforce within health and care and create a vibrant culture within the wider workforce\u201d through collaborative work to standardise what data professionals are, what they do and their development.\nThe Centre has also trialled a powered biopsy device called OnControl that aims to shorten the procedure to take bone marrow biopsies from patients, with trial participants calling the process \u201cmuch less stressful and painful\u201d.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "30 South West GP practices to utilise AI tool to help identify vulnerable patients at risk of ED admission", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/11/ai-helps-identify-those-at-risk-of-emergency-admission-in-the-south-west/", "content": "\nAn artificial intelligence tool is to be rolled out across 30 GP practices in the South West to help identify vulnerable patients at risk of emergency admission.\nThe roll-out follows a pilot project that saw integrated teams using the AI tool to provide proactive care in this cohort and as such reduce attendance in A&E departments by a reported 60 percent.\nThe Brave AI system uses an algorithm to identify patterns in registered patients\u2019 records, assessing their risk of unplanned hospital admissions within the next year; care teams can then use this information to reach those in need, offering personalised support such as remote health monitoring, to prevent admissions from occurring.\nNHS England shared how, as part of the AI\u2019s primary care pilot,\u00a0teams from NHS Somerset and North Sedgemoor PCN examined data from more than 500 care home residents across 35 care homes, tracking their health and care over a period of 18 months.

Yet the way we manage medicines, largely using paper processes, has not changed significantly since the birth of the NHS in 1948.\u201d\nThe review highlights key areas of progress including changes to the General Medical Services Contract from 1 October 2023, which now allow GPs to authorise prescriptions digitally; and the Primary Care EPS Programme Board\u2019s approval of \u201ccross-border community pharmacy nomination\u201d, meaning prescriptions from GPs in Wales can be collected from pharmacies in England, and prescriptions from GPs in England can be collected from pharmacies in Wales.\nOn secondary care e-prescribing, the review notes progress including funding for every health board to prepare for the procurement of one of three approved supplier solutions, and the creation of \u201ccommunities of practice for health professionals across Wales\u201d which allow the sharing of learning across organisational boundaries. The ePMA project at Swansea Bay is anticipated to release up to 9,166 hours of time to care, and to produce a 10 percent reduction in medicine costs compared with the previous year.\nOn the shared medicines record, the review details progress including the completion of a technical proof of concept for data sharing, testing with the National Data Resource programme, and a period of user research which helped the team \u201cbuild a picture of its overall purpose and the features it would need\u201d.\nOn plans for the future, it includes use of EPS among early adopters from January, all University Health Boards and Velindre University NHS Trust completing procurement by Spring, the implementation of ePMA being \u201cwell underway\u201d throughout the year, and the SMR being operational within the National Data Resource by the end of March.\nTo read the review in full, please click here.\nIn December, Digital Health and Care Wales opened a tender worth an estimated \u00a320 million for the establishment of a framework agreement that will see DHCW take on an agile product delivery partner, with the aim of enabling specialist resources to be \u201ccalled off as and when required to support DHCW and the Digital Services for Patients and the Public programme in delivering the NHS Wales App.\u201d\nThis month, a contract valued at \u00a35.19 million for non-clinical decision support software for NHS 111 Wales was awarded to US-based company, Priority Solutions Inc.

Raj is also NHS England\u2019s deputy chief medical information officer and chair of the NHS Clinical Leaders Network.\nRaj shared with us his career to date, as well as the journey he has been on in creating the Eric Moore Partnership Medical Practice, which has won multiple accolades including being rated as \u2018Outstanding\u2019 by the Care Quality Commission. In addition, Raj has established the Medi-Centre Warrington, described as a \u201cstate-of-the-art healthcare premises\u201d, and embraced technologies in support of better patient care.\nRaj\u2019s journey into primary care\nWe first asked Raj whether he could tell us a little bit about his background and his career to date.\n\u201cI originally trained in hospital medicine, training at large hospitals across England, but I soon discovered that creating change in large organisations is often more challenging, especially within public sector-led units. As much as I enjoyed clinical medicine, I often looked across at the rapidly-evolving general practise structure in England in the late 90s and recognised that primary care offered significant potential for change and transformation, especially for someone at the early stages of their medical career. As a young junior doctor I was passionate about making a real difference to patients and to their care pathways; I had a healthy dose of visible and youthful enthusiasm for change that must have been visibly evident.\u201d\nOne of the challenges that he came across at the hospital where he was training was \u201cincredibly long waiting lists for endoscopies, which should usually be between four to six weeks, but at that time had gradually lengthened to over 26 plus weeks.\u201d Raj described how he initiated and helped deliver a project, starting with perusing the available data to look at where the referrals and demand were coming from.\n\u201cWe found that there was an increased demand from the community, because of an Increased awareness of dyspepsia, its link to gastric and oesophageal cancer and bleeds. Prior to\u00a0my planned move to general practice, I had an interest and trained in gastroenterology. Having a foot across as a GP trainee in primary care gave me a better understanding of the interface challenges. The upper GI endoscopy lists at that time were originally individualised to each consultant surgeon or physician. Working together with the consultants and a manager from the hospital, we unified the lists across all consultants and also created a direct access gastroscopy service.\u201d\nIn addition, Raj described how he undertook\u00a0educational updates at GP practices on the revised NICE guidelines for dyspepsia, around appropriate referrals and better management of patients within primary care with new medication. \u201cThis early successful project brought the waiting list down over a period of six months, to just two weeks. It was my first transformation project and gave me a better insight into the workings of the NHS across primary and secondary care divides. It also helped me understand how to get the very best for patients by working differently with colleagues across the primary/secondary interface. The value of having accurate referral and waiting times data helped with this project significantly. I always said that having data alone isn\u2019t sufficient, you need to know what to do with it, how to interpret it and convert it to intelligence.\u201d\nRaj enjoyed being able to help in this way. \u201cIt gave me a real buzz \u2013 as a medic, I loved to make my patients feel better, but being able to create change within a system that benefits wider groups of patients was also an amazing feeling.\u201d\nAs a young doctor, he added, the move into general practice was transformative.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what general practice could offer at that time \u2013 you could create your own space for patients as you deem fit, work in a manner that worked for you and your patients. You could even trial and dabble with different software; you didn\u2019t have to get multiple approvals from boards or external agencies. You could engage with any supplier organisation you wanted to, as long as they were safe, patients were happy, and you had their consent.\u201d\nAt that time, he said, general practice had just started the funding and utilisation of computers across primary care. However, the reality was that adequate data capture hadn\u2019t quite caught up.\n\u201cI moved up to Cheshire from Lincolnshire as a newly-qualified GP \u2013 fresh, enthusiastic, wanting a challenge. I was invited by a primary care manager colleague who had worked with me previously in Lincoln, to offer temporary support for a medical centre in Warrington for a week. Little did I know that it was going to become my long-term base for the rest of my career! The Eric Moore Health Centre was highly rated and respected when it was built in the 60s, and for the three decades thence, but by the late 90s, when I came along, the doctors who had worked there for three decades plus were clearly getting exhausted, and many of them were well past the retirement age and just hanging on to help support their much loved patients. When I first entered the practice, I noticed was that there were plastic sheets and covers on these very impressive looking big desktops, and the plastic sheets covering them had even started accumulating dust on them.\u201d\nThe GPs were still using paper prescriptions and at best were using the computers just to print prescriptions.The local health authority managers and the local GPs within the health centre were delighted when Raj accepted a longer-term role in transforming the health facility, and Raj got what he describes as his \u201cdream job\u201d, not only as a valued GP, but also as the practice executive/transformation lead.\nRaj set about implementing a fully-functioning IT system, ensuring that all clinicians and staff utilised IT for all aspects of patient care, including appropriate data input/coding. This helped with clinical searches and audits supporting clear data extractions, and helped with delivering quality and assessing patient safety-related processes including prescribing.\nRaj worked on helping his retirement-aged GPs to get used to using the computers, to using templates, protocols and introducing a digital appointment booking system. Raj also began to perform audits on patient data and assessing patient volumes so that the practice could be prepared for demand, which he said was \u201cwell ahead of the curve at the time, in the early 00s\u201d. Raj then brought in senior managers and like-minded clinicians to continue transforming the facility.\nNational projects\nRaj moved on to talk about how he began working at a national level, alongside his role as a GP.\n\u201cIn the early 2000s, a US-based company called Revive got to hear about our work in primary care informatics. They asked through the local hospital-appointed \u2018booking manager\u2019 if I wanted to work with them on developing and piloting electronic referrals. At that time, referrals were all in paper formats and quite a struggle; they would take easily about two weeks from seeing a patient to being approved by a hospital consultant leading to a referral. We used process mapping exercises with our teams just to explain why it took so long.\u201d\nPatient notes would be entered into a computer and a letter would get dictated, then would sit on a tray to be transported to the secretary\u2019s office. \u201cIt used to take a day to two days, even though it was only down the corridor,\u201d Raj noted. Then the secretary would type it up, bring it to Raj in paper form to be amended before Raj would then send his amended copy back to the secretary, with the final copy being retyped and collected by the hospital to be sent by \u201csnail mail\u201d a day later. On top of that, he said, the consultants, being as busy as they were, would usually review \u00a0letters once or twice a week and only then accept the referrals. By the time the patient was allocated an appointment, it usually would have taken a minimum of two to three weeks.\n\u201cWe used the Revive software, and I liaised with like-minded hospital consultants to ensure that referral letters reached them the same day that they were typed; the consultants then needed to commit to answering the letter within one day. Although this involved a bit of IT software across the primary/secondary care interface, it was mainly clinicians who wanted to see this change to make a difference to patients, that actually made it happen.\u201d\nRaj continued: \u201cThe national team from the Access and e-booking team from the Modernisation Agency suddenly got really interested. We had an amazing local electronic access manager called Ros, who was equally interested in this \u2013 she highlighted the work we\u2019d done nationally, and all of a sudden, we realised that we had made one of the earliest electronic booking systems in England. Unbeknown to us at that time, the government had just launched the multibillion national programme for IT, and one of the key deliverables was electronic booking with the ability to choose, called \u2018Choose and Book\u2019. My work in Warrington was highlighted and I ended up presenting and sharing our experiences nationally. I was then appointed into my first proper job in informatics and digital transformation \u00a0as national clinical lead for Choose and Book as one of the first few clinicians appointed into the ambitious National Programme for IT.\u201d\nRaj highlighted that despite him accepting a part-time position nationally, his main passion continued to remain in general practice and clinical practice.\n\u201cMaking my patients feel happier or satisfied when they left my room or when I left their homes was always my first priority, and I always found that after a really long surgery, as tired as I might have felt, I would always go home happier and satisfied that I had made a real difference to my patients. I have always said that it\u2019s a true privilege to be a GP and also to be in a unique position to make a real long-term difference to patients and their families. It\u2019s never a job; but a role, responsibility, and a truly honourable vocation.\u201d\nThe revamped practice ended up becoming one of the exemplars for Choose and Book nationally, winning a national award for effective IT implementation.\nRaj then moved his attentions to \u201cusing every single facet of IT available from the NHS, and from wider sources. I initiated a 10-year practice transformation \u00a0project \u2013 we called it the Eric Moore practice integration project.\u201d\nDeveloping the Eric Moore Medical Practice Integration Project\nRaj described how the transformation project came to fruition. A four-phase approach was planned for the group of single-handed GP practices within the Eric Moore Health Centre in Warrington. Phase one focused on connecting everyone in the building with the value of using IT. \u201cWe did that really effectively, using the old Microsoft processors, and we supported a continuing training programme for all of our team members,\u201d Raj said. He noted that at the time of his entry to Warrington, the Health Authority was \u201cincredibly helpful\u201d; the centre had rapidly become at risk of closure when GPs started retiring, and among its population were deprived areas where people lived 10 years less on average than people over the river in Cheshire. \u201cIt was in the Health Authority\u2019s interest to keep the practice viable and fully supported.\u201d\nThrough the project, Raj aimed for the practice to become paperless. In 2000, Raj visited Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare provider in California, and was impressed with how they mandated the utilisation of effective IT input across all aspects of care for their patients. This further motivated Raj to make a real difference and transform his practice in Warrington.\nWithin one year, the practice had become \u2018paper-light\u2019.\n\u201cI banned patient notes being brought into a doctor\u2019s room, which in turn would force GPs to use the computer to not only access records and data but also to input the same,\u201d Raj shared. \u201cSummarising and making relevant entries of all existing notes was the highest priority, and we pushed data summarisation by bringing in medical students and other trained data entry specialists, who worked late evenings and weekends, and blitzed the paper records.\u201d They identified a storage company to move their notes out to make space, but Raj noticed that when he asked to access any notes, the company would locate them, scan them, and send them in electronically. He approached them and suggested that they scan the notes before they were put into storage. \u201cThey agreed, and I balanced the cost against the storage space that we would need. This move started the process of scanning documents across patient records, which over time was done by all practice front office staffers and a routine day-to-day document management process, making us paperless.\u201d\nPhase two of the project involved amalgamating all four single-handed practices together into one, which became the new Eric Moore Partnership Medical Practice. Raj explained how working hours, patterns, on call/duty doctor sharing, held joint education and clinical governance meetings were connected between the practices, with an ethos of joint working. By the end of this phase, they had appointed a single practice manager and were amalgamating finances and staff.\nPhase three was about converting the integrated practice team into a transformation exemplar across multiple projects, including digital transformation, practice governance, and leadership model transformation.\u00a0 \u201cWe brought in patient self check-in screens, we supported patients to access their records \u2013 initially we could send them a link to look at the basic reports with full consent, but then we created a records room, where patients could sit in and a receptionist could sit in with them.\nPhase three also placed focus on ensuring that they had a multi-professional team. Raj described how they empowered nurses and other non-medical clinicians to join them, and changed the leadership structure from a GP-led model to a multi-professional matrix leadership model with a GP, practice manager and lead nurse. Raj noted that staff have benefitted from the incentivisation model and called it an \u201camazing journey\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are proud to say that we still have the same successful enhanced model today. We had an initial list size of 3,600 when I joined, and now we\u2019ve grown to over 12,600 patients, becoming one of the larger GP practices in Warrington.\u201d\nMoving on to phase four of the EMP integration project, Raj explained how the two new buildings have supported his and his practice team\u2019s wider ambitions for patient care, including bringing in an integrated primary\u00a0care delivery model supported by secondary care\u00a0specialised services and imaging services.\n\u201cPhase four needed a fit for purpose infrastructure, and a key need was to have a world-class, \u2018connected\u2019 building. I approached different colleagues with the model for the building and reiterated that it wasn\u2019t just about a building for general practice; rather, we wanted a community facility that would provide the infrastructure for a wider variety of healthcare services. Our aspiration was to have specialist consultants come in and work with us. We wanted to have imaging and scans undertaken in the community, and we wanted the scan reports to be in our own patient systems rather than sitting on somebody else\u2019s.\u201d\nThere was some pushback initially from the local hospital about doing scans in the community. Raj got a consultant from a different hospital to see if they could get a grant to buy an ultrasound machine, and once they had secured that, they set up a pilot to do ultrasound scans, creating one of the very first community ultrasound services in the country.\n\u201cIt offered results in the same week, rather than six weeks in the hospital. It was amazing, and all the practices in Warrington said, \u2018Raj, can we dip into this service?\u2019 So we floated that offer as a separate entity, which still holds contracts across Cheshire and across Yorkshire and the North West. That has a life of its own now, and we got a consultant radiologist to lead that, along with a great team of people.\u201d\nPhase four also involved fitting in diagnostics, X-rays and scans, Raj continued; then they had to provide space for a mobile scanner in the car park, with the right clinicians managing the same. \u201cHaving a fully-fledged day case theatre facility in the community was also an aspiration. All of this was successfully built and achieved with the opening of the new Medicentre Warrington as the same site of the previous health centre in 2016 .\u201d\nCreating a connected building : the new Medicentre, Warrington\nRaj talked us through how he went about creating the kind of \u201cconnected building\u201d that he envisaged for the new integrated practice.\n\u201cWe wanted the building to provide access and support to consultants, where patients can receive most things without having to go in to hospital. We already demonstrated, by bringing in consultants to work with us and work on our systems, that we had better output for patients and we saved the system money by employing consultants within our practice and running it as a day case hospital. We had visits from the national teams to see how that model can work, and at that time there was a big push to move more consultants out into the community. You don\u2019t need to have a dermatologist or rheumatologist sit within a hospital building, but rather to be scattered across the community doing community clinics, which in turn brings them closer to the patient. The build for the facility started with the practice buying the existing health centre site from the NHS at market rates, and a build that delivered what is now possibly the most advanced health facility in the community in Cheshire.\u201d\nThe Medi-Centre\u2019s unique development of a \u201ccommunity-based day case theatre\u201d was highlighted by Raj as a major achievement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the facility for 25 air changes, which you need for orthopaedic procedures and so on. Normally, GP practices would have a simple 10 air exchange unit attached to the wall, but that needed to be changed and filtered for major procedures. It has wi-fi in every single corner of the building, with a virtual remote receptionist supporting first-floor patients and an MRI docking station in the car park. There are multiple stations for patients to be able to access their records, and self check-in screens. We have a phone system that measures the total number of calls and uses cloud-based web technology, which will show you how many people are waiting and how long they\u2019ve waited. This is becoming commonplace now, but when established it, it was unique from a GP practice perspective. On a daily basis, the practice manager will share a single screenshot to see the average time a patient waited on the phone, and the average time spent by the receptionist on the phone, so everybody is aware of how well they are doing. We ended up answering calls within one minute, and we also streamlined our appointment system so patients could book appointments directly.\u201d\nRaj added that they have put iPads in the main play area to encourage children to learn about healthcare content, and they encourage patients to bring in their iPads and connect them to the internal system. They are also working on developing a practice YouTube channel and additional social media channels to help convey messages on health and wellbeing. Every clinician has committed to providing at least one video podcast a year on relevant topics.\nIf you walk into the practice today, Raj described how you will find \u201ca main reception with two or three receptionists, and then upstairs we have a soft consulting room for patients who have mental health issues who need a quiet space, and when they go upstairs they\u2019re greeted by the remote receptionist from the back office.\u201d\nUltimately, Raj said, \u201cIt\u2019s time we brought IT innovation into the NHS.\u201d\nUsing IT and technology to support better patient outcomes\nRaj went on to share some of the work that he and his team have been doing using IT and data effectively. He also spoke\u00a0about the practice\u2019s \u2018CarePlus scheme\u2019 that supported some of the most vulnerable in society and was developed with four main area of focus and calls to action, alongside their patient participation group.\n\u201cWe had a very poor level of management of diabetes amongst our patients, which worsened over the pandemic, so we started using technology to support us and our patients. Using the continuous glucose monitors, which monitor blood sugar levels and how it reacts to different foods, was a great start. The monitor is available now on the NHS to allow us to prescribe the same. We set up a \u2018diabetes action plan\u2019, and we set up a process where patients with very poor control of diabetes are targeted. They are given training on using the app and sent home with the patch that monitors blood glucose. They would give access to our lead diabetes practice nurse, and every day she would check the screen, so she can see live readings of glucose for the list of patients. She could pick the phone up and speak to them if she needed to check anything. It\u2019s amazing to be able to use technology to be able to do that. We also have an automated blood pressure machine and a weight machine in the waiting room, which connects into the system \u2013 patients don\u2019t have to make appointments just to get their blood pressure and weight done, they just need to put their name and date of birth in, and it goes straight into the system.\u201d\nAnother area of focus was cancer care, which Raj noted had become even more challenging over the pandemic. He described how the practice looked into long waiting lists for cancer and noted that patients were struggling as were the\u00a0health\u00a0and care system. \u201cWe therefore appointed a cancer care coordinator who supports people with a direct line to these individuals through a surgery hotline and email that was monitored every day. Patients are given direct access into a dedicated VoIP (voice over Internet Protocol) number which is manned all day at the practice, and they get priority access, they can send messages, send photographs, and so on. The practice developed its internal audit of cancer care patients, which tells us who has been waiting the longest; which of these patients actually have an established diagnosis of cancer; and what stage they\u2019re at. It\u2019s all managed by a dedicated team who coordinate with the\u00a0different cancer care teams and McMillan and Hospice teams enhancing and supporting the patients journey. We would like to\u00a0believe\u00a0that we have made all efforts to ensure that our patients have a positive\u00a0experience of the system through what is possibly the most distressing phases of their\u00a0lives\u201d.\nRaj also shared the two other areas of the CarePlus programme \u2013 a \u201cphysio-cercise scheme\u201d offering specialised weekly exercise classes to its elderly patient population, and\u00a0\u00a0the \u2018\u201dhomeless medical service\u201d for Warrington, supporting people experiencing homelessness from across four sites with. dedicated team of outreach clinicians, and prioritisation for same-day appointments as they are classed as a \u2018hard to reach\u2019 population.\nMaking change\nRaj touched upon some of the most important things he has learned on how to make change happen.\n\u201cI think people always think somebody needs to give a handout to make things happen, and the great thing with primary care is you don\u2019t have to wait for handouts,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are delighted that as a practice team, we have been awarded \u2018Outstanding\u2019\u00a0in our care of our patients by\u00a0the\u00a0Care Quality Commission. Our\u00a0consistent\u00a0use of data and\u00a0technology has helped us improve our access, improve the quality of care, improve the patient\u2019s experience of the practice. One of the key elements to our success is in ensuring that patients are our partners in everything that we do \u2013 we have a very active patient participation group.\u201d\nFinally, we asked Raj what his priorities are in digital and technology at Eric Moore over the next ten years.\n\u201cIn the next 10 years, I hope we can look at AI enablement and empowerment of patients \u2013 I\u2019d like us to move from where we are currently, i.e. where it\u2019s very dependent on the system; to a model where we can use effective algorithms to direct patients to self-help pathways which can be personalised. The key word here is personalisation\u00a0of care. And I\u00a0believe that AI is going to help us offer that for the longer term, in a manner that no single clinician can contemplate delivering. I am not worried or frightened of AI becoming too independent or taking over clinician\u2019s roles. I fully believe that we shall be at the helm, using AI-enabled processes to be able to transform\u00a0how we deliver care.\u201d\n\u201cFor instance, I\u2019d like to give all of our patients avatars, so for example, if you are drinking too much, your avatar can show you the inside of your body and demonstrate what your live blood readings for alcohol and its effects are. It will tell you that this is directly related to the amount of alcohol you consumed in the last week.\u00a0Another example is to have continuous blood glucose and other constituents\u00a0monitoring.

Clare chatted with us about ongoing digital projects and programmes in NW London, as well as sharing insights into successful digital social prescribing and priorities for the future.\nDigital projects and programmes\nTo begin, we asked Clare if she could tell us about some of the digital projects and programmes she has been involved in over the last few years.\nClare explained how she is presently working on three projects, including a \u201cCase Management System (CMS) for social prescribers which allows integration between primary care clinical systems (EMIS and S1) and a CMS.\u00a0 This means GP practices can refer directly to the social prescriber and other ARRS roles with the click of a button and the social prescriber can push back any relevant information to the patient\u2019s record clinical record.\n\u201cMy second project is around somatisation, now called Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Misdiagnosis of BDD can lead to unnecessary investigations and treatments, resulting in significant costs to the NHS. Our project aims to use social prescribers or other ARRS roles to offer patients psychological emotional and social health support as an alternative.\u201d\nThe third project, Clare said, revolves around the Sensley app. \u201cThe app is being piloted in Brent which has a high number of Gujarati-speaking patients,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps patients to better manage their diabetes by sharing health and wellbeing information to support long-term condition management.\u201d\nClare has worked as a social prescriber/care coordinator in a number of GP surgeries in NW London and as a IT Facilitator for the ICB delivering training on S1 to GP practices. She also took part in the Digital Pioneer Fellowship with the Learning HUB platform for primary care staff.\nA CMS for North West London\nClare explained that a focus of her work over the past two years has focused on bringing in a CMS for social prescribing and other ARRS roles that would link in with GP clinical systems, so that information would flow without the need to cut and pasta data from spreadsheets where information on the patient\u2019s progress was held in the past. To apply for funding, the ICB looked at where social prescribers sat digitally in NW London and what sort of tools would be useful to help them do their jobs effectively. A CMS, Clare noted, was highlighted by social prescribers \u201cas a must\u201d.\nClare\u2019s team went out to procurement for the CMS two years ago, she explained, and looked at most CMS on the NHS framework.\n\u201cI engaged with a lot of social prescribers too, and then we jointly viewed demonstrations from each provider to see if they met our criteria and specifications. In the end a CMS called Joy was chosen and we commenced the rollout. There are four PCNs out of 45 who are not using the system which is a massive change in working practice.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if they will ever get the final four on board as it is not a compulsory system to use but we will give it our best shot. Hopefully word will spread to the final areas via our social prescriber\u2019s network, who are best placed to encourage sign up.\u201d\nNW London is the \u201cfirst ICB in London to implement a CMS on such a large scale,\u201d Clare shared. \u201cI believe other ICBs have started the process with perhaps one borough or council; we have eight boroughs within our footprint, and every one of them is covered by the CMS.\u201d\nShe added that the\u00a0NW London Digital First team is happy to share their experience with other areas and have been working with a number of areas discussing the rollout. \u201cWe received great guidance from Peterborough and Cambridge \u2013 why reinvent the wheel?\u201d\nSocial prescribing in North West London\nWe asked Clare about the current digital priorities for social prescribing in North West London.\nClare said: \u201cAlthough the rollout of the CMS is nearly complete, it is used differently in each PCN/borough due to the variance in PCN management structures and social prescribing service delivery models \u2013 some PCNs employ their social prescribers, other commission voluntary or council groups \u2013 and so we work to accommodate each individual setup.\u00a0 There is a lot of good work being done and we want to share this learning across the ICB.\n\u201cIn order to do this, Digital First, along with our partners NAPC (National Association for Primary Care) and social prescribers, have produced a template SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and are holding face to face Action Learning Sets (ALS) in each area to gain and share lessons learned. ALSs are usually face-to-face discussions to iron out and share solutions on issues around technology, stakeholder behaviours and patient management.\u201d\nClare emphasised the need for data to ensure that the social prescribing roles are valued and sustained:\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t evidence benefits then we may lose this essential job role. With Joy CMS, we can report on the number of referrals per practice, PCN, borough or ICB. We can see how the patient was affected by the intervention and what onward referrals were used to improve patient care. We can also see the breakdown in demographics and services used which could aid commissioning intentions in the future.\u201d\n\u201cFuture plans would be to enhance the Joy Marketplace, a directory of services which allows the user to directly refer or signpost their patients to a local service. This is also public-facing, and can be used by everyone to refer. This is an ongoing piece of work for which there is no funding at the moment, and we are encouraging each area to take on the responsibility for uploading services themselves.\u201d\nDigital in the future\nWhat does Clare hope to see from digital in the future?\n\u201cI think a lot of funding has gone towards making primary care more digital \u2013 we have electronic prescribing, record transfer (GP to GP), online consultations, etc, and now we need to copy this great work with social care, secondary care and hospitals.\n\u201cA good example of what good looks like is the NHS App. I fractured my wrist recently and before I had left the fracture clinic, my next appointment was pinged to me via the NHS App. I could also see the letters sent from my consultant without the need for a paper copy and view them all on my primary care record. We need one record held by the patient which we can share when in a clinical environment \u2013 no more faxing or paper records.\u201d\nWhat advice would Clare give to someone who might be about to embark on a similar journey with digital social prescribing?\n\u201cInvolve everybody,\u201d Clare replied. \u201cDon\u2019t put in a digital system that has not had approval by the stakeholders who will use it. It is hard enough to get people to accept change, without it being something they have not asked for. Test the validity with your social prescribers, your PCN managers, GPs, practice managers, and make sure it actually works and is tested out.\u201d\nIn addition, Clare said: \u201cPick a provider who is supportive and responsive to your needs, as this is not always the case after the contract has been signed. Finally, have a sense of humour and don\u2019t take offence \u2013 not everyone likes change, and you will be making them do something new and different even when they feel things were working just fine.\u201d\nWe\u2019d like to thank Clare for her time, and for sharing with us her work on digital social prescribing in North West London.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Mid and South Essex NHS FT chief exec Matthew Hopkins on implementing a system-wide EPR, investing in foundational tech, and more", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/08/mid-and-south-essex-nhs-ft-chief-exec-matthew-hopkins-on-implementing-a-system-wide-epr-investing-in-foundational-tech-and-more/", "content": "\nWe recently heard from chief executive at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, Matthew Hopkins, on the digital landscape at his trust in 2023 as well as his hopes and aims for 2024.\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of our ambition at Mid and South Essex NHS FT for what can be achieved with digital transformation and innovation,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cWe have a clear digital strategy and a long term plan to make MSEFT a truly digital first organisation. Combined with our commitment as a trust that everyone who works here has an opportunity to innovate, we support a wide range of new technologies, support innovators, and have seen a number of big projects really take shape. These projects will use digital to help create a digital hospital for the future, and serve our staff and patients in supporting reliable, high quality care.\n\u201cThis year we have seen over 10,000 staff using digital applications to identify areas for improvement, to access guidelines and good practice, or to undertake a change project in their department. We have built up our novel Quality Learning System to its next phase of development, aiming to give everyone at the frontline of care access to key quality indicators every day, and moved to a single, digital ITU system across our critical care units.\n\u201cPossibly most notably, we have started a major transformational programme, working in partnership with Essex Partnership University Foundation Trust, to implement a first of type system-wide EPR. This programme connects patient data across community, mental health and acute care settings, and will change the way we deliver care to embed truly integrated whole system pathways.\n\u201cTo underpin this and keep our organisation safe and secure, we have begun a sustained programme of investment in our foundational technology that will bring the legacy systems of previously separate hospitals together as a single trust configuration. We recognise that having a sound technology base is critical for supporting patient safety, connected care and innovation into the future.\u201d\n2023 saw the collaboration with clinicians and operational teams across EPUT and MSEFT yield \u201cexciting progress in bringing services together to maximise clinical and patient benefits,\u201d Matthew noted. \u201cThrough collaborative efforts we have gained a deeper understanding of our people, their roles, and the overarching purpose of our work, aligning with the transformative capabilities of technology. We have over 700 digital champions and an active Founders Community helping shape our future.\nLooking to 2024 and beyond, Matthew shared: \u201cWe will be renewing and co-producing with staff and partners our trust strategy in 2024, and enhancing our understanding of how data and technology can enable us to grow as a trust and system. Through continued close collaboration with EPUT and MSEFT clinicians and local patients, we aim to harness technology to empower and enable clinical expertise, working together to design and implement the changes we need to see in readiness for our new EPR.\n\u201cWe will continue to show leadership in innovation, hosting as we do on behalf of NHSE England the Clinical Entrepreneur InSites Programme, now as a hub for 17 sites across England.\n\u201cWe will build on the developments from this year, were we implemented a number of key clinical systems and made strides to virtual working across major service areas such as outpatients, where we have also tested and evaluated use of artificial intelligence to reduce healthcare inequality.\n\u201cWith partners in the community, we have also developed the first self-serve digital equalities impact assessment tool, and used augmented reality to support people with a learning disability and/or autism. We are excited to have received funding to continue and expand this work in 2024.\u201d\nMatthew concluded: \u201cThe greater visibility of the benefits of digital and the greater connectivity for our staff will drive further interest and engagement in our vision of a digital first organisation. We will focus in the coming year on digital skills and on diversifying the routes into our digital workforce, as well as raising profile of our data and digital functions, which are so vital to enabling us to be one team, working together for excellent patient care.\u201d\nMany thanks to Matthew for sharing his insights.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026Poll: Five years from now, how many GP clinical system\u2026Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust opens early engagement\u2026North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare pilots VR tech to\u2026Dr Dan Bunstone on utilising digital tech for a population\u2026North Staffordshire Combined launches patient app with\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Scotland Excel opens \u00a325 million technology enabled care goods framework for 32 local authorities", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/08/scotland-excel-opens-25-million-technology-enabled-care-goods-framework-for-32-local-authorities/", "content": "\nScotland Excel has opened an opportunity for tech-enabled care goods and services on behalf of the 32 local authorities in Scotland.\nThe estimated total value of the framework is \u00a325 million, to initially run for 24 months, with the potential to be extended for two further periods of 12 months each.\nIt\u2019s divided into lots, with the first lot being for digital dispersed alarm units that communicate with the receiving centre and connect with relevant peripheral devices, valued at an estimated \u00a38.5 million.

I\u2019ve moved more predominantly into digital health over the last 20 years. My current role is general manager for digital health for five counties in Ireland: Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, and Monaghan. There are nine of us across the country, and we all sit in the community in health operations \u2013 they were new roles that came around about two years ago now. A big focus has been around creating and embedding a digital culture of change. This includes empowering staff and patients, supporting national clinical programmes, telehealth, and also supporting and advocating for operations and patients.\u201d\nIn Ireland, Aislinn commented, the community side of healthcare has traditionally been a little deprived from a digital point of view as a lot of digital health work focused on the acute side. \u201cIreland doesn\u2019t have an electronic health record in community \u2013 there are pockets of really good practice,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done, and there has been a lot of work that has been done.\u201d\nIn addition, Aislinn has completed an MSc in health informatics, with her dissertation focusing on the acceptability of using telehealth, as well as an MSc in digital transformation.\nDigital projects and programmes\nOne of Aislinn\u2019s first digital projects was in 2007/8. \u201cI suppose it shows the advancement, because if you look at it, we\u2019re only just doing some of this stuff now in Ireland,\u201d she commented. \u201cThat project was developing a long-term condition telephone service in collaboration with the Met Office. We used early AI to identify when there were weather synapses, and then that would trigger automated phone calls that went to patients to advise them to use their emergency medications. It reduced hospital admissions, so that was forward thinking at the time; that was one of my favourite projects I\u2019ve worked on.\u201d\nMore recently, Aislinn described how the head of older persons services from her area, Frank Morrison, came to her to highlight problems around bed utilisation. \u201cPreviously, they relied on nurses reporting bed usage in excel sheets, which would get passed on to Frank\u2019s office on a monthly basis,\u201d she shared. \u201cYou can imagine; by the time they collated information from all 19 hospitals, that information is out-of-date. They didn\u2019t have real-time data, so that meant they were spending about three to four hours per day on telephone calls to find the information as they needed it.\n\u201cWe were interested in how we could get that data in real-time, so we worked with an organisation and used a Power BI and power apps to get the nurses to input data on a daily basis about their bed usage. That goes onto a live dashboard, so automatically they have a live view of what is going on in the different areas. Bed utilisation increased by 20 percent within three months, so it was a huge impact. The tech wasn\u2019t actually a big part of it \u2013 I think this project just goes to show how simple solutions can actually have the biggest impact. It was all about the people, the process, and trying to find solutions that fitted into the staff pathways. The five principles of digital transformation for me are strategy and culture; engaging stakeholders; data, which is really key; the process; and then the tech bit is the bit that just comes on top. We were delighted to win a HSE award for engaging a digital solution to provide a better service.\u201d\nAislinn went on to tell us more about some of what is happening around digital in Ireland at the moment, saying: \u201cThe telehealth roadmap just launched, along with the virtual wards strategy \u2013 they are two areas of priority at the moment, and there\u2019s work going on to try and get the infrastructure in place. A new Digital Health Strategy is on the horizon. For community, one of biggest digital change programmes, the ICCMS, which is the Integrated Community Case Management System, is currently underway.\u201d\n\u201cPeople feel like they are not \u2018digital\u2019, when in fact they are\u201d\nAislinn shared insights into digital health in Ireland with regards to staff appetite.\n\u201cAn early project I did was a collaboration with seven of the other community healthcare organisations; we carried out the largest survey that\u2019s ever taken place from a digital perspective in Ireland, with over 4,000 respondents. There were some key findings behind that \u2013 for example, a low percentage of our staff reported that they had had formal training, so that showed a clear need for more support.\n\u201cHowever, when it was essential to use technology \u2013 for example, mandatory training via a digital platform \u2013 98 percent showed confidence. The survey just demonstrated the fact that people feel like they\u2019re not \u2018digital\u2019, when in fact they actually are; they just don\u2019t seem to transmit that into the work environment.\u201d\n\u201cIn our area, thanks to support from Dermot Monaghan, chief officer and executive management team, we are seeing a culture shift in digital attitude and adoption. Collaboration with senior management, other digital team colleagues, e-Health, Chief Clinical Information Office, but most importantly staff and patients is key to success.\u201d\nAchievements and future plans\nWe asked Aislinn what she was most proud of from her time working at HSE.\nShe said: \u201cI think it\u2019s my team, and the culture change we are making within our five countries. It started off with just me and we\u2019ve grown into a team of seven. We\u2019ve made great in-roads, we\u2019re doing a lot of work with stakeholders, we\u2019re looking at how we can change the mindset about digital. Staff are actually approaching us, and really starting to adopt some of the digital tools and some of the things we have access to.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with a lot of offices now, helping them move to paper-light. There\u2019s a lot of talk all the time about digital health records; but actually there\u2019s more we can be doing with our services, in HR, in corporate, in admin. There are a lot of services that can be digitised now that can bring improvements.\n\u201cWe actually have a lot of the tools we need. I\u2019d say we have around 80 percent of the tools we need to do business as usual. There\u2019s lots we can do with what we\u2019ve got, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. My staff have developed some online guides and webinars, capitalising on what might be considered \u2018basics\u2019 to some people; but it\u2019s about how they can use it in their pathways.\u201d\nWhat are you most excited about in terms of digital health in the future?\nAislinn said it comes back to the basics again. \u201cWe need an electronic health record across Ireland; that would solve a lot of our problems,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving that would then allow us to explore further innovation, and digital transformation \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of exciting stuff. I\u2019ve been looking at waiting lists; I think there\u2019s so much that can be done even before a patient even comes through our doors. There are ways that we can track symptoms, find out where people are on their journeys, to best support them to get the right care, at the right time, in the right place. We just need to get the basics in place first.\u201d\nWe would like to thank Aislinn for her time, and for sharing her insights and experiences with us.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026News in brief: anxiety app for children in Gloucestershire,\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "\u00a35 million award for non-clinical decision support software for NHS 111 Wales", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/02/5-million-award-for-non-clinical-decision-support-software-for-nhs-111-wales/", "content": "\nA contract valued at \u00a35.19 million for non-clinical decision support software for NHS 111 Wales has been awarded to US-based company, Priority Solutions Inc.\nThe deal covers non-clinical decision support software to support non-clinical call handlers to take initial calls to the service.

By March 2024, DHSC plans to publish the minimum operational data specification for assured digital social care record systems to implement. By winter of 2024 there are plans to make the data access tool available to the sector; also by 2024, client level data collected from local authorities will replace annual short- and long-term collection. By 2025, submission of CLD will become automated; and by 2028, data collected from care providers will be \u201cstreamlined as far as possible\u201d.\nMoving on, DHSC shares some of the work that has been undertaken to develop understanding of the current data collection landscape, and demonstrates how data flows through collections from the adult social care sector. It notes that findings from the public consultation on health and social care statistical outputs, launched in December of 2023, will be utilised to develop delivery plans over the next year.\nWith regards to understanding the data sector\u2019s needs, DHSC presents findings from \u201cextensive engagement\u201d that has been undertaken since February 2023, with sector representatives, key stakeholders, individuals and organisations. Data gaps highlighted by feedback include data on the social care workforce, including recruitment rates, retention rates, capacity, pay and conditions; outcomes and user experiences; demographic data to improve understanding of those who draw on care and allow the exploration of any disparities in their experience; information on unpaid carers and their demographics; and planning forecasting provision, to support a better understanding of \u201cwhich models of care are most successful\u201d in meeting needs.\nLimitations to maximising the value of data are outlined, including the in data sharing, data protection, data standardisation, and integration of services. Five limitations to adult social care data are identified as the limited digitisation of the adult social care sector, with around 50 percent of providers having digital care records, and reporting lack of infrastructure as a key challenge; lack of data availability; duplication of data collected lack of standardisation and harmonisation in how data is collected; and gaps in the data collected. Steps to be taken include the development of a new social care data access solution, which will offer a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d that reduces the burden on the sector and improves care experience.\nActions are set out with the aim of improving adult social care data,\u00a0including developing a national provider level minimum dataset, rolling out client level data collected from local authorities, implementing a social care workforce survey to understand wellbeing among the formal social care workforce, and improving social care data sharing and dissemination via a new social care data access solution. The chapter also outlines how the publication of the final minimum operational data specification in 2024 will provide \u201ca defined information standard which will act as a springboard for delivering further quality, efficiency, and organisational improvements across health and care\u201d.\nIn addition, the guidance shares details on plans to develop a new digital tool that will allow care providers, local government and central government \u201cbetter access to social care data\u201d, including access to \u201cexisting and new national social care collections, such as client level data\u201d. The new tool will provide secure access to vital adult social care data, offer a single source of truth for the sector to refer to, and reduce the \u201cburdens and costs associated with data processing, analysis and access to insights across the sector\u201d.\nNext steps highlighted include working in partnership with stakeholders and people to develop and design the implementation of the measures it sets out, exploring ways to address local challenges such as data sharing and interoperability, and engaging with \u201ca diverse range of voices across the sector\u201d to ensure the right data is being collected to drive change and measure success.\nTo read the guidance in full, please click here.\nIn other news on data, the NHS England Board\u2019s December meeting covered operational and financial performance, an update on the Federated Data Platform, and the role of tech in the delivery of the primary care access recovery plan.\nFrom Newcastle, research leaders at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are using a digital dashboard to analyse data on research activity, which is helping to \u201cinform and embolden\u201d their strategic thinking and planning.\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026Universal Care Plan for London expands to include people\u2026Over 40 HTN Now online webinars planned for 2024HTN at Rewired 2024: what does the future hold for the NHS\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Surrey Heartlands ICS awards contract for virtual care digital platform solution", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2024/01/02/surrey-heartlands-ics-awards-contract-for-virtual-care-digital-platform-solution/", "content": "\nAn award notice has revealed that a \u00a32.975 million contract for a virtual care digital platform solution across Surrey Heartlands ICS has been awarded to Doccla UK Limited, after a procurement process which saw a total of ten tenders submitted.\nAccording to the award notice, the virtual care digital platform solution is required to support the delivery of a patient-centred model, as well as to deliver multidisciplinary and collaborative health services.

In this dynamic landscape, the commitment, and perspectives of everyone involved are as crucial, if not more so, than the technology itself. To unlock the full potential of the investment, it\u2019s essential to invest in people, embracing their passion, knowledge, and concerns.\n\u201cEngagement and delivery take centre stage. We must pose challenging questions to the right individuals, seeking the information we genuinely need. It\u2019s about avoiding confirmation bias and ensuring that we gather insights from those who can provide the most valuable perspectives, rather than simply hearing what we want to hear.\u201d\nRob Birkett, chief digital and information officer at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust/The Health Informatics Service, commented: \u201cOur digital hopes for 2024 include the rollout of a new Patient Experience Portal following a successful procurement this year. This could be a game changer in terms of all non-face-to-face interactions with patients across all our services. We are aiming to improve our HIMSS position with some planned work around closed loop prescribing and patient communication.\n\u201cA robust infrastructure should be a given in modern healthcare, so further optimisation work planned throughout 2024 including core and edge network devices, increasing our cloud provision and continued focus on cyber security. 2024 will see further development of our approach to data science, using a data led approach to service redesign, supporting both our reconfiguration of services programme as well as our role as a system partner in reducing some of the current pressures provider organisations are facing. All this alongside hopefully bringing a 3rd trust onto the joint EPR instance in late summer 2024, increasing the shared support provision across all 3 trusts. Looking forward to a busy year!\u201d\nAlexis Farrow, programme director for Digital Notts, added: \u201cOur priorities are based on data and insight, and we know what good looks like for the citizens of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. Thinking ahead to 2024, we\u2019ll continue to develop projects that will make a real difference, ensuring that these become embedded within the ICS stakeholders.\u201d\nJames Crowther, chief technology officer, The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, noted: \u201cIt has been fantastic working with colleagues to deliver our patient portal in 2023. Now, 75% of our patients have been converted onto digital appointments \u2013 which is no mean feat.\n\u201cWe will continue to build on our infrastructure and IT Ops maturity, set up a new diagnostic centre in the heart of Liverpool, and support the procurement of a new LIMS for Pathology and AI systems for Radiology across our system. We are also proud of our new digital strategy which sets out an ambitious agenda for 2024 and beyond.\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working together as a team to:\u00a0Empower our staff to be digital;\u00a0Empower our patients and their carers to engage with their cancer care;\u00a0Re-fit our EPR to achieve better outcomes and experiences for our clinical teams;\u00a0Harness data and intelligence to drive forward our operations, clinical service innovation, and research.\u201d\nCorrina Hulkes, chief nursing, midwifery & AHP information officer at London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, said: \u201cLooking forward to 2024 for London North West Healthcare Trust, we are still working on stabilisation and ensuring good adoption, but also with an eye to optimisation as we receive feedback from our end users. For myself as CNIO, the priorities going forwards are to optimise the workflows for nurses, midwives and AHPs. We have both a local and a sector wide nursing documentation governance and standards group to review all documentation and how it is being used. And having just implemented a 3rd party care planning solution, we look to make the most of this tool in reducing unnecessary burden and documentation for nurses. Ensuring the documentation carried out is efficient and reflects our professional standards.\u201d\nJill Watson, senior IT project manager, The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, added: \u201cThe programme plan for 2024 is already full of exciting new developments. Moving into January, Gateshead FT will be the first to start work on sharing maternity data from BadgerNet, and then once live and sharing, there is a plan to onboard the rest of the 7 Trusts.\n\u201cGP Connect is also planned to go live in early 2024, with the first phase providing standardised HTML reports from across all primary care services. The second phase to GP Connect will provide structured data, including documents, consultations, medications and allergies.\n\u201cWe are also excited to announce that Tees Esk & Wear Valleys FT will start to implement their data sharing, which includes a considerably broad range of data, and complete both Mental Health Trusts sharing data into GNCR. The programme will also continue to onboard Local Authorities, with the plan to start seeing data from Gateshead Council, South Tyneside Council, Hartlepool Council, Westmorland Council and Cumberland Council (formerly Cumbria County Council).\n\u201cIn Q2/Q3 2024, the aim is to upgrade the system to include the capability to both consume and share data to the National Record Locator (NRL), this is also a national objective set out for all shared care records. To compliment the NRL, there are also opportunities being explored to retrieve reasonable adjustment flags (RADF) and child protection information.\u201d\nDr Amar Ahmed, partner & GP trainer, Wilmslow Health Centre, commented to say: \u201cWe look forward to healthtech developments in the coming year that are using AI to improve efficiencies in primary care. A few products in the pipeline show much promise, for instance in reading, summarising and coding incoming documents. This could really help take some of the load off our admin and clinical staff as we receive increasing unfunded transfers of work from secondary care into primary care.\n\u201cWe are also testing new EPRs which could break the oligopoly of EPR suppliers we are left with in primary care. Getting an up-to-date, cloud based, open-API EPR has the potential to revolutionise primary and community care in the coming years.\u201d\nMorgan Daly, digital strategy transformation lead, One Care, noted: \u201cOur priorities for 2024 include continuing to identify and safely implement emerging tech and digital tools with our General Practice partners. This includes evaluating online consultation tools, examining the future of electronic patient record systems in General Practice, and continuing to support roll-out of Robotic Process Automation. Ultimately, we want to ensure GPs are making best use of the tools available to them to thrive, and to give the best possible care to their patients.\u201d\nLiz Leggott, project manager, greener NHS champion and NHS England clinical entrepreneur,\u00a0South Yorkshire Primary Care Workforce & Training Hub: \u201cOur hopes are that we will attract funding to create a Training & Simulation centre; if not, the very least we can hope for is to continue trialling the training and placement experiences that embrace technology and use it to increase capacity and quality of experience. We have many projects born out of that larger Innovation Centre project that we want to finish and begin to use properly and effectively. The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan requires a new way of thinking and we believe this is it.\n\u201cI personally want to begin to tell others about our experiences, about our learning, and actually about our failures. Letting other people gain from our mistakes and learning points. I also want to further cultivate the partnerships we have with our local HEIs, MedTech companies, our ICS and the Health Innovation Network, which will only strengthen what we have and what we know.\n\u201cI think by adopting tech in training, we equip our workforce with more confidence and capability when it comes to adopting any technology that comes their way. We need to have a digitally adept workforce, so by embedding it wherever we can, we hope to effect that change.\n\u201cWe feel we are effecting a change in process, in system and in culture.\u201d\nLincoln Gombedza, practice educator facilitator, Practice Education Team at Harplands Hospital, North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare Trust:\u00a0\u201cLooking ahead to 2024 and beyond, my digital health hopes and aims include:\n\nAdvancements in AI:\u00a0I hope for further advancements in AI, particularly in areas like predictive healthcare, where AI can anticipate health issues before they become critical.\nNursing Documentation Standards:\u00a0Improving nursing documentation standards using AI can lead to better patient care and efficiency. AI can assist in creating more streamlined and accurate documentation processes.\nPersonalised Healthcare:\u00a0The use of digital tools to provide more personalised healthcare experiences, tailored to individual needs and genetic profiles.\nExpanded Telehealth Services:\u00a0Continued expansion of telehealth services to reach underserved communities, ensuring equitable access to healthcare.\nIntegration of Wearable Technologies:\u00a0Greater integration of wearable technologies in monitoring and managing health conditions, providing real-time health insights to both patients and healthcare providers.\nFocus on Mental Health:\u00a0Digital platforms focusing more on mental health, offering accessible and anonymous support for those in need.\n\n\u201cThese aims and priorities reflect a desire to harness technology for more effective, personalised, and accessible healthcare, with a strong emphasis on data security and patient privacy.\u201d\nCatherine Murphy, practice manager, Saddlers Health Centre: \u201cFor 2024: I am looking to continue to promote the use of online services, to continue to update the website on at least on a monthly basis, to increase our patients\u2019 use of the NHS app, and we are in the process of contacting patients for them to provide an email address as a method of contact. To encourage patients to consent to the summary of care record and shared care planning, promoting graph net use with staff. To increase the number of appointments available to be booked online by patients through the relevant apps/website. To remind patients that they can be contacted via video consultation by the GP if required.\u201d\nChristopher Matthews, head of digital education and simulation, Education Directorate, Horizon Centre, Torbay Hospital, said:\u00a0\u201cIn 2024, with regards to digital healthcare, we aim to broaden our engagement with trust staff and the wider community to support digital adoption. Through the development of programmes such as XR Deep Dives for clinicians and Digital Literacy Clinics open to all Trust staff, we are continually building on the offer we can provide. This is particularly important given the future implementation of an EPR, so during 2024 we will aim to provide support to build upon digital readiness for this system.\u201d\nCharlotte Brown, communications specialist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, noted: \u201cLots of exciting projects are planned in for 2024, the first project will be expanding the use of our Electronic Healthcare Record, PICS, to our paediatric departments. Technical work to prepare PICS for paediatric patients has already begun and is near completion, from January 2024 staff will begin to receive training on how to use the system, then the system will be rolled in February/March 2024.\u201d\nDidi Craze, specialist communications midwife, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u201cWe will focus on launching the new staff app and continue developing the Microsoft Teams channels to create a one-stop place for staff to access information and updates. I am also keen to support staff who find digital access overwhelming and offer education sessions to demonstrate ease of access via our digital platforms.\n\u201cThe overall aim is to keep refining the flow of information out to staff to make their time on digital devices more effective, and less overwhelming.\n\u201cAnd to keep widening the flow of communication back to the senior team so that staff feel able to raise concerns and share experiences of working on the ground, as well as their quality improvement ideas.\u201d\nPam Pahal, digital transformation lead at Midlands Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust: \u201cExpanding the use of the patient portal to support mental health transformation for children\u2019s services. Using the portal to input leaflets for parents, which are easier to access and stored in one location. This will help improve children\u2019s health and wellbeing.\n\u201cWe will expand the use of the Patient Portal and look at integrating it with digital mail solutions to reduce the need to print physical letters that are viewed by service users in the portal. The money saved from printing can then be re-purposed into other areas that will provide better care for our service users.\n\u201cExpand the use of the Virtual Assistant across other service areas to give better accessibility to other MPFT services.\n\u201cTo optimise our current EPR by integrating with other solutions that enable clinicians to have better access to the information they need, which will facilitate decision making. To ensure the workflows within our EPR are designed to optimise operational processes that enable valuable clinical time to be spent with our service users.\n\u201cWe have approx. 30 projects to deliver in the next two years that will increase the digital maturity of our primary EPR and the services that use it, along with tackling convergence from multiple systems to help create a single, shared patient record where possible.\u201d\nNickee Smyth, implementation programme manager, Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: \u201cThere is no decrease in demand for our services as we move into 2024. As a Digital Healthcare Team, we are passionate about collaborating with partners at a system level, making our digital solutions as effective as possible and creating new opportunities for clinical and operational advancement. From a Cheshire & Merseyside perspective, our priorities lie with ICS PACS and LIMS programmes and the continued development of our Patient Engagement Portal which is linked in with the national Wayfinder project.\n\u201cWe are committed to empowering our patients to take greater responsibility for their own care through functionality that allows them to manage hospital appointments, digitally view their letters and clinical records and provide their data to us remotely.\n\u201cOn a more local level we continue our journey of minimising paper within the organisation, improving care and increasing efficiencies across the trust. Our move to a new data warehouse \u2013 expanding out to all of our corporate areas is keenly awaited, taking our Business Intelligence to the next level and helping to further drive decision making. Generative AI technologies provide exciting opportunities for the immediate future, identifying key areas for safe deployment is firmly on our agenda in the months to come.\u201d\nBen Panton, senior digital business development manager, NHS Arden & GEM, noted: \u201cSupporting primary care teams will continue to be a high priority for 2024. People will be all too familiar with this sector\u2019s key challenges including demand pressures, workforce retention and patient access requirements. Digital tools and solutions can not only help to address some of these challenges but also enhance patient experience and generate capacity and efficiency opportunities.\n\u201cThrough our collaborative dialogue with GPs and Primary Care Networks, we are looking at how we assess digital maturity and optimise our use of technology. This covers everything from ensuring that basic infrastructure and training is in place through to greater adoption of tools such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The benefits here are not just in terms of efficiency, capability and interoperability but also in improving work/life balance for staff by using digital to release time for more valuable, patient-facing activities.\u201d\nRichard Pratt, Three Spires Medical Practice: \u201c2023 brought with it\u00a0 a new dawn of AI with solutions such as ChatGPT into our lives, 2024 will see this expand into an exciting new chapter of AI in healthcare. Understandably, there has been hesitancy to embrace AI solutions immediately, with questions being asked regarding safety, data governance, data-set bias, efficacy and more, but we are running out of time and need to tackle these issues and blockers to progress.\n\u201cAs a PCN, we are involved as an NHSE Digital Neighbourhood, who will embrace an AI tool for risk stratifying patients and identifying those patients at most risk of admission to hospital.\n\u201cThere has been an upsurge in beta testing of co-pilot offerings which are likely to start to gain real traction in 2024. Long before AI replaces a human clinician, it will become instrumental in augmenting our effectiveness through streamlined admin processes. Co-pilots that can act as assistants: pulling together summaries of medical histories; ordering a set of blood tests with a single voice command; or automatically dialling up the next patient in a busy duty list of ring backs. All will offer the marginal gains that will make the lives of busy clinicians better, and thereby allow them to care for patients more sustainably.\u201d\nThe digital health team at Isle of Wight NHS Trust, shared their plans, including: \u201cImplementation of call centre functionality;\u00a0Further asset tracking and potential patient tracking;\u00a0Installation of new air conditioning and UPS in the main Data Centre;\u00a0Relocation of the Cloudian backup solution;\u00a0Setup of backups and replication to Azure Cloud;\u00a0Integration of new Edge network security;\u00a0Setup of new virtual firewalls for streamlined network security;\u00a0Implementation of soft phones for enhanced end-user communication mobility;\u00a0Patient clinic location improvement through guest wireless;\u00a0Extension of 6GHz wireless connectivity for improved speeds;\u00a0Management of power consumption on the wired LAN;\u00a0Efficient use of power and air conditioning units in the main Data Centre;\u00a0Relocation of A0 (Network core) to the Main Data Centre for reduced footprint.\u201d\nWe would like to thank all contributors for their time, and look forward to following these developments through 2024 and beyond.\nRelatedHTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026New systems introduced through digital transformation\u2026Interview: Victoria Betton, PeopleDotCom, on the importance\u2026Open opportunity for advice and training to tackle digital\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Deep dive: innovation strategies, innovation pathways, and adopting a culture of innovation", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2023/12/29/deep-dive-innovation-strategies-innovation-pathways-and-ingredients-for-success-in-nhs-innovation-adoption/", "content": "\nFollowing the publication of NHS England\u2019s blog post on \u201chow to bake innovation into the NHS\u201d and the key ingredients for success in this area, we looked at some of the practical and strategic ways in which trusts across the country are embracing innovation and developing innovative strategies to meet health system challenges.\nPlacing research centre stage at University Hospitals of Leicester\nUniversity Hospitals of Leicester (UHL) NHS Trust recently published its Research and Innovation Strategy 2023-28, outlining plans to drive innovation through active research and partnerships with universities, enhanced access to healthcare data, and medical technology.\nWorking with the University of Leicester, UHL has attracted \u201csubstantial\u201d external research funding and hosts facilities including an NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, an NIHR Clinical Research Facility, and an NIHR-CRUK Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre.\nThe strategy sets out the aim for UHL to take a lead role in developing and implementing an ICS-wide research strategy with the aim of maximising collaborative opportunities and ensuring that research becomes a key pillar to achieving the best results for patients. It celebrates partnerships such as those with the University of Leicester, for enabling the advancement of \u201cnew medicines and medical technology innovations to impact on healthcare for our multi-ethnic population\u201d.\nUsing examples of virtual wards and AI detection of lung cancer, the strategy highlights plans to work across the ICS to develop IT to enhance access to healthcare data for research from patients receiving care in hospital, virtual wards and in the community.\nOther plans include increasing the number of clinical trials, using social media to increase awareness of clinical research, working to ensure research is embedded \u201cfrom board to ward\u201d, and designing innovation challenge competitions for UHL staff.\nInvestment in infrastructure and innovative technologies at Leeds Teaching Hospitals\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust\u2019s Research and Innovation Strategy, running until 2025, focuses on three ambitions: to deliver high quality clinical research, to champion this research, and to grow a world-class clinical infrastructure and assets for research and innovation (physical and digital).\nOn engagement, the strategy highlights the importance of the trust\u2019s underpinning philosophy that \u201cresearch is for all\u201d, committing to increase the visibility of research to patients and staff, invest in the trust\u2019s Research Academy as an \u201cinternationally-recognised incubator for research delivery training\u201d, and develop an \u2018Innovating the Future\u2019 programme to support staff with innovative ideas for new technologies.\nDigital technologies will also play a key role in developing the trust\u2019s research operations, with aims including the continued development of digital tech to track and monitor performance to inform resource allocation, and developing the skills required to deliver new trials relating to technologies such as AI and real-world data studies.\nThe strategy highlights the need to \u201ctake a proactive approach\u201d to developing partnerships with SMEs and companies in industries including biotechnology, medical devices, AI and digital, to help \u201caccelerate the development, evaluation and adoption of new products\u201d.\nOn digital and data, the strategy emphasises the \u201ctransformative\u201d role that data will have for healthcare in the future, committing to developing a programme of work to digitally enable the trust\u2019s research, working with partners to \u201cdevelop a portfolio of high quality research which utilises real-world datasets\u201d, and developing capabilities to provide de-identified datasets for research.\nFinally, on infrastructure, the strategy points to the \u00a310 million investment in research infrastructure and the creation of new facilities in the \u2018Building the Leeds Way\u2019 programme, including the \u00a33.3 million clinical research facility at St James\u2019s campus for early-phase clinical trials of new drugs, devices, and diagnostics.\nInnovation and quality improvement at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre\nThe Clatterbridge Cancer Centre\u2019s Innovation Strategy 2023-25 places a focus on the trust\u2019s commitment to \u201ctaking its place at the forefront of healthcare and innovation\u201d. \u201cBe Digital\u201d is one of six strategic priorities set out by the strategy, in terms of identifying, leveraging and creating digital innovations and technologies to transform the organisation.\nOn supporting the adoption of innovation, the strategy highlights the Centre\u2019s commitment to providing faster access to new treatments and ways of working, taking a \u201cflexible and agile approach to change\u201d, and relying on rapid assessment frameworks and pilots to test new concepts for adoption. This will include a commercial evaluation service to \u201csupport the validation and subsequent adoption of newly developed products\u201d.\nOver the next three years, the trust aims to help a shift in culture to encourage staff to \u201cspot problems and suggest solutions\u201d, to provide access for staff to resources for self-improvement and skills development, and to establish a process for the evaluation of innovations.\nInnovation pathways: study highlights \u201cdifficulties faced by the NHS in encouraging and adopting innovations\u201d\nA study published in the Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science\u00a0journal has looked at innovation pathways within and around the NHS, considering the extent to which they address \u201ccurrent challenges faced by innovators\u201d and \u201careas for improvement and future study\u201d.\nOn regional pathways, the study refers to Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs, now known as Health Innovation Networks) as \u201cperhaps the most important regional infrastructure for innovation\u201d, noting that they are \u201cwell placed to take advantage of individual academic and industrial strengths of regions\u201d, drawing on strategies such as using innovation scouts and working closely with university research hubs. It also notes the role of Applied Research Collaborations, with the specific aim of accelerating the rate innovative research is adopted in clinical practice; and Regional Medicines Optimisation Committees which are able to propose their own priorities, facilitating \u201ctop-down and bottom-up consideration of innovation priorities and policy changes\u201d.\nIn terms of national pathways, the study identifies nine, including the Accelerated Access Collaborative, NHS England, NIHR funding schemes, the NHS Innovation Accelerator and Innovate UK. It notes the AAC\u2019s role in providing a \u201csingle front door to the innovation ecosystem\u201d, as well as its provision of training to help clinicians bring innovations to market.\nFinally, the study presents several alternative innovation pathways, including angel investors, venture capital, start-up accelerators, and equity crowdfunding.\nThe study moves on to discuss the challenges. One such challenge is \u201cthe fragmented nature of the NHS\u201d, which authors find presents barriers particularly for SMEs \u201cwho may be unaware of impactful regional variation\u201d in digital or bureaucratic structure. Authors also identify challenges in accessing clinical data for SMEs and early innovators, barriers in accessing funding and support, and \u201cthe earliest invention stage\u201d which is often ignored or overlooked.\nTo conclude, authors offer recommendations include \u201cexpanding and clearly defining the leadership role of the AAC in the innovation landscape\u201d to overcome the existing fragmented nature of support pathways, and providing more support for innovators at the earliest stage of the innovation process \u2013 invention. The \u201cpressing need for a high-quality, independently funded review of the innovation landscape\u201d is also recommended.\n\n\n\n\nCitation: Anmol Arora, Andrew Wright, Tsz Kin Mark Cheng, Zahra Khwaja and Matthew Seah.

These are: creating a health system which \u201ctruly values research\u201d; fully integrating research teams across academia and the NHS; allowing NHS staff time for research; equipping healthcare staff with the skills to engage with research; embedding flexibility into postgraduate training pathways; and streamlining research through joint R&D offices.\nOn creating a healthcare system that truly values research, the report recommends that NHS trusts and Health Boards \u201cshould have responsibility for valuing and promoting research across the organisation, and annually publish information on the outcomes and benefits of all of its research activities\u201d; and that organisations including NHS England and NHS Improvement should work to develop research metrics to evaluate research activity in primary care and encourage GP practices to engage in research.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the header of integrating research teams across academia and the NHS, the report recommends that funders of research should \u201cdevelop schemes to encourage greater mobility across sectors\u201d, that higher education institutions should provide honorary clinical academics with access to infrastructure such as \u201cgrant-making machinery\u201d and journal subscriptions, and that higher education institutions should consider offering honorary academic appointments to healthcare professionals who \u201ccontribute significantly to research\u201d.\nTo provide NHS staff with time for research, the report recommends the launch of a pilot scheme where a proportion of consultants are offered a contract including dedicated time for research, and that income generated through NHS research activity should be reinvested back into research endeavours.\nRecommendations under the remaining three key outcomes include the provision of professional opportunities for development for healthcare students, and the development of a \u201cmore integrated research office function\u201d between NHS R&D and higher education institution research offices.\nTo read the report in full, please click here.\nRelatedSBRI Healthcare and the Health Innovation Network award\u2026Norfolk and Waveney ICB among eight organisations joining\u2026Research and innovation hub in Bedfordshire, Luton and\u2026North East and North Cumbria ICS pledges to adopt\u2026Pilot projects in Buckinghamshire to further develop\u2026Humber Teaching NHS plans redesign of mental health crisis\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "North Lancashire and South Cumbria pilots AI and teledermoscopy tech", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2023/12/28/north-lancashire-and-south-cumbria-pilot-combines-ai-and-teledermoscopy-to-support-diagnosis/", "content": "\nA pilot programme combining AI and teledermoscopy with the aim of diagnosing and treating people with skin cancer earlier is underway in North Lancashire and South Cumbria,\u00a0and is hoped to enable clinicians to \u201creview more suspected cancer cases in a shorter space of time\u201d.\nIn partnership with medical technology company Skin Analytics, clinicians from University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) will use an AI technology called DERM to analyse images of skin lesions, to help support decisions on whether further examination is required in clinic.\nDERM is currently in use across 13 NHS trusts, and uses machine learning and AI image analysis technology to identify cancerous lesions. Clinical trials and real-world testing have found that, when identifying melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer, DERM has \u201csimilar accuracy to dermatologists whilst also identifying seven out of every 10 benign lesions that do not require specialist input\u201d.

We\u2019ll also develop recommendations for how the product can be safely implemented and whether case studies exist from other places to illustrate that it works for GPs. In 2023, we broke new ground by supporting a Bristol-based GP to launch robotic process automation for the first time in our ICS, with more innovations to come in 2024.\u201d\nRichard Pratt from Three Spires Medical Practice said: \u201cOne word that has been on everyone\u2019s minds in primary care in 2023 is access. The health tech sector is at its best when it turns its attention to the real world problems in primary care. For years the focus has been on delivering a high quality service \u2013 rightly so, but a high quality service has neither impact nor benefit if patients can\u2019t gain access.\n\u201cThe drive to create a digital front door to access primary care has come from two directions: NHSE and patients. NHSE\u2019s publishing of the Recovering Access to Primary Care demonstrated their commitment and the growing uptake by patients for tools like online or SMS consultations shows their readiness too.\n\u201cThis year, health tech has launched and progressed a myriad ways to address access challenges \u2013 from triage tools to online consultations. These offer no single solution to address the yawning chasm between need and provision but can at their best, offer a multiplier effect. Effectively creating more of our scarcest resource \u2013 clinician time.\n\u201cRather than a single game-changing tech solution, we\u2019ve realised a suite of tools will be crucial in meeting the access challenges. Many are intended to liberate our time. Whether it be pump-priming conversations with patients by asking for details of their illness before picking up a phone or using voice-to-text dictation solutions to speed up consultation entry, they are rapidly becoming central and uptake wide spread, crucial in shoring up the primary care upon which we all depend as a nation over 330 million times each year. \u201d\n\nPam Pahal, digital transformation lead at Midlands Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, said that the delivery of a patient portal for adult mental health service users stands out as a key achievement from 2023. The portal \u201cenables service users to access their mental health care plan, appointments, letters, patient reported outcome measures and a suite of self-care tools at their fingertips,\u201d said Pam. \u201cThe patient portal is fully integrated with the NHS App, making it accessible and easy to use through one front door which is familiar to our service users.\n\n\n\u201cThis portal works with our core EPR, which means information that service users input into the portal can flow into our EPR for our clinical staff to view. This means Patient Reported Outcome Measures can be completed outside of appointments (if the patient chooses to do so). This will help facilitate better conversations to take place during the consultation. There is a healthy lifestyle questionnaire which enables patients to think about the choices they are making and promote self-care change behaviours. The portal has enabled patients to have a choice to access their health records via a digital app or web portal.\n\u201cFor adult mental health service users, and MSK service users we have piloted an AI powered virtual assistant. This enables patient to access their appointment information using the trust\u2019s website, this is accessible 24/7 enabling patients to view and cancel appointments. This provides choice to our service users, and the accessibility of out of hours was showcased by 40 percent of service users using the VA out of office hours.\n\u201cThese are the digital projects we are most proud of because of the innovation enabling patients to have a choice in the way they access their healthcare information. The designs were developed alongside service users, clinical staff, digital and transformation staff in collaboration. They have provided a different route for service users to manage their own health.\u201d\nCorrina Hulkes, chief nursing, midwifery & AHP information officer at London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust\u00a0shared: \u201c2023 has been a very busy year for London North West Healthcare Trust digitally and also operationally, as we went live with a Cerner EPR in August of this year. One of the most exciting parts of this is that we joined a sector wide domain and across North West London we now have one shared EPR for the Acute Provider Collaborative, which include 4 organisations and 12 acute hospitals. This was a mammoth task and was over two years in the design planning. There are challenges in ensuring no variance and any new build or changes need agreeing by all the four organisations, but this has brought opportunities in challenging existing build and ensuring evidence based practice that is standardised in the sector and reflects national and in some cases international recommendations.\n\u201cWe have a very good and inclusive governance structure that ensures that there is good discussion and agreement and each organisation has an equal voice, and one shared change board with also a separate governance meeting with membership from both clinical and non clinical digital leads from each organisation.\u201d\n\nFrom The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, emergency department consultant Dr Ashish Singal\u00a0said that a source of pride is the development of a \u201cdepartmental app that provides all the relevant and up to date information at the clinicians\u2019 fingertips and at the patients bedside.\u201d Ashish explained how the app contains \u201cguidelines, policies and procedures, directory with direct dial facility to any extension in the hospital, alert functionality and push notifications, ability to fill in forms ie annual leave requests, sickness reporting, training and CPD section, links to rotas, over 300 patient information leaflets, online induction and mandatory training. Since implementation two years ago, the app has had over 500,000 hits.\u201d\n\n\nWe heard from Rob Birkett, chief digital and information officer at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust/The Health Informatics Service: \u201c2023 has been a great year for both delivery and foundation building for digital here at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust and The Health Informatics Service (THIS). Our digital roadmap was developed alongside senior clinical and operational colleagues ensuring the developments we delivered were directly linked to improving patient care, reducing health inequalities and supporting the current pressures the NHS is facing. These developments included some first of types such as Electronic Controlled Drug Register (eCDR) and an EPR Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) module.\n\u201cWe also had a successful rollout of our NICU EPR, integrated diagnostic results into our maternity system and implemented 4AT dementia screening which is now being used in multiple trusts.\n\u201cIn terms of our approach to data science, we had some great success around identifying high risk adult cohorts linked to our length-of-stay as well as using a data-led approach to waiting list validation supporting our aim to reduce health inequalities, especially around learning disabilities. One of our biggest successes in 2023 was a nurse/AHP/midwife-led complete redesign of our nursing documentation within our Oracle Cerner system \u2013 a joint implementation across two, soon to be three, trusts, with benefits for both colleagues and patients.\u201d\n\n\n\nRob continued: \u201cWe have worked on a number of initiatives this year that will take us further forward throughout 2024 and beyond. One of these was a joint initiative with the University of Huddersfield developing a digital specific nursing placement focusing on digital in a modern nursing environment including virtual wards, e-observations, e-prescribing, point-of-care testing, virtual consultations and the importance of data/good use of an EPR. This has been very well received and we are looking forward to our third cohort in the spring.\u201d\n\nLincoln Gombedza, practice educator facilitator for the practice education team at Harplands Hospital, North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare Trust,\u00a0shared five key \u201cnoteworthy advancements and projects that stand out\u201d.\nThe first is\u00a0AI and machine learning. \u201cThere was significant progress in AI, particularly in natural language processing and understanding. This led to more sophisticated and user-friendly chatbots and virtual assistants, aiding in various sectors from customer service to mental health support,\u201d said Lincoln.\nSecondly, Lincoln raised telemedicine and digital health. \u201c2023 also witnessed a surge in telemedicine, driven by the ongoing needs from the pandemic. Digital health platforms became more integrated, offering seamless experiences for both patients and healthcare providers.\u201d\nThe third project revolved around remote work technology, with Lincoln raising how the enhancement of these technologies continued \u201cwith better collaboration tools and virtual meeting platforms, making remote work more efficient and accessible.\u201d\nFourthly, Lincoln pointed to a \u201cstrong focus on developing more sustainable and energy-efficient technology, reflecting the growing awareness of climate change.\u201d\nLincoln\u2019s final point was around cybersecurity, explaining: \u201cGiven the increase in digital activities, there was a considerable emphasis on improving cybersecurity measures to protect data and privacy.\u201d\nJill Watson, senior IT project manager at The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\u00a0shared how the Great North Care Record (GNCR) has \u201ccontinued to grow from strength to strength in all aspects, including technical delivery, digital maturity, adoption and usage and true regional collaborative working. \u00a0The programme has achieved some real progress with onboarding new connected partners including local authorities, hospices, 0-19 services, child information services and maternity services.\n\u201cIn parallel to the onboarding, the programme has also successfully completed developments to be able to retrieve data from BadgerNet, maternity services EPR, Tees Esk & Wears Valleys FT new EPR, Cito, and GP Connect, both HTM and structured data, which is the strategic vision of the national programme.\u201d\nJill added: \u201cThe proudest element to GNCR is the people, the partnership working across health and social care, spanning across over 64 organisations, who are all driven to make it succeed, despite other work pressures. \u00a0The NENC region truly aim to deliver better patient care and as a programme playing a part in that, there is nothing more rewarding. GNCR has become an established platform for health and social care professionals in our region and is reaching consistently just under 580,000 per month and growing.\u201d\nDr Amar Ahmed, partner & GP trainer at Wilmslow Health Centre,\u00a0said that \u201cby far the most significant challenge to primary care locally this year\u201d was challenges with IT infrastructure. \u201cDays of productivity were lost due to IT systems, in particular our electronic patient record. It can\u2019t be right that so many hard-pressed practices across the UK were brought to a standstill by IT outages\u2026 We look forward to having more choice of EPR providers in the coming months so that we improve our practice\u2019s productivity and reduce frustrations felt by all members of our team.\n\u201cIn house, we have developed an award winning triage system which has been adopted by many practices across the country. The Wilmslow Triage System improves patient access and goes some way to help practices meet the BMA\u2019s safer working guidance. The practice was proud to have had its endeavours recognised in receiving an international award.\u201d\nFrom Saddlers Health Centre, practice manager Catherine Murphy\u00a0described how from 2023 various changes were made in regards to digital transformation, including the registering of a patient online service. This \u201chas worked very well for our surgery,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cWe have seen an increase in patients registrations from signing up to this service. We also signed up for the text message confirmation to the patient once the registration had been completed; this too has saved our reception staff time. The online registration forms have all the relevant information we require to register the patient. Other information can then be noted and added once the patient has had a new patient health check. It is much easier for staff to add the registration to the system, saving time.\u201d\nAdditionally, Catherine shared how Saddlers Health Centre promoted online access to all patients via text message, letting them know how to access the service via a link. \u201cWe have found an increase in patient using this service which has freed up time spent on the phone lines,\u201d she confirmed.\n\u201cWe changed our website provider which has been an enormous help. \u00a0The information displayed on the website is now up-to-date, informative not only with services at the surgery but community services in and around the Walsall area. We have recently completed an audit on this, and have patient benefit results from this work. Not only can patients register for the surgery on the website, they have information regarding NHS App and patient access app, booking of appointments, ordering prescriptions, contacting the surgery on line and so on.\u201d\nAdditionally, the surgery has completed the electronic records uploading to their clinical system. Catherine called this \u201ca major help when copying medical notes for patients/third parties as all the information is in one format and one place. This also freed up space in our surgery as we no longer have paper notes to file.\u201d\nFinally, Catherine shared how the centre has improved their star rating on NHS Choices by sending out texts with online links to questionnaires asking for feedback, noting that they have received \u201cfantastic reviews\u201d from this.\n\n\nFrom Nottingham, Digital Notts\u2019 programme director Alexis Farrow highlighted that the digital transformation team for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire ICS \u201ccontinues to have a positive impact across our local healthcare ecosystem. We\u2019ve recently reviewed our digital strategy until 2028, with five priority areas underpinning our work, including public facing digital services, digital and social inclusion, and interoperability.\u201d\nAlso from Digital Notts, project and business change manager for technology-enabled care and digital inclusion, Rosie Atkin said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made great steps in addressing digital inclusion across our ICS throughout 2023. From embedding our innovative digital inclusion coordinators across our PCN, digital champions training with local partner organisations, through to our nationally recognised asthma and peak flow digital self-management project, our focus on continually evolving our technological offering is making a difference to the citizens of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire ICS.\u201d\n\n\n\nCharlotte Brown, communications specialist at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust,\u00a0said: \u201cOur electronic healthcare record, PICS, has now successfully been rolled out across all our adult inpatient and outpatient clinics, including the Birmingham Chest Clinic. This means PICS is now being used for more than 3,000 beds across our four hospitals and community settings. PICS, a system developed by UHB and the Wolfson Computer Laboratory, is the largest single in-patient EHR deployment in England, a massive achievement for us here at UHB.\n\u201cSince the rollout began in November 2020, the digital health team have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to train over 18,000 staff, deliver 1,240 laptops and computers on wheels, create 107 archives and launch 15 go-live dates.\n\u201cColleagues across the trust are now reaping the benefits of the successful implementation of PICS, with the system being widely used across clinical services. In one year alone, the system saw over 67 million results reported, over three million prescriptions issued, and 119 million observations recorded.\u201d\n\nFrom Midlands Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, we heard from\u00a0Shaun Allcock, head of health and social care systems: \u201cIn alignment with the Digital Capability Framework, we have put together a comprehensive programme comprising approximately 30 projects ready for delivery over the next two years. These projects are made to elevate the digital maturity of our primary electronic patient record and its associated services. A key focus of these projects is the harmonisation of different systems to facilitate the creation of a unified and shared patient record wherever feasible. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate these projects to enhance the efficiency and coherence of our infrastructure.\n\u201cA milestone in our recent projects is the implementation of a patient portal. This portal is now operational, playing a role in supporting our mental health framework. It is a platform which allows patients to have access to their health information, making healthcare more accessible.\u201d\nChristopher Matthews, head of digital education and simulation for the Education Directorate, Horizon Centre at Torbay Hospital\u00a0shared: \u201cDuring 2023, from a digital education perspective we have seen considerably more requests both from internal and external sources for 360 VR training packages, as the access to immersive equipment becomes more readily available. We\u2019re proud of this content and have produced a range of passive and interactive VR experiences such as an ODP orientation and a falls deterioration experience for care homes.\n\u201cA collaboration between the digital and simulation teams has been fruitful in the development of mixed reality training experiences that provided broader opportunities for community staff to engage with simulated training without having to travel to the sim suites at the Hospital. Through the setup of a green screen inside our sim van we can run simulation training anywhere the van can visit. Through the use of passthrough technology we are able to incorporate real subjects and objects into the virtual environments that we have developed in house.\n\u201cThere has been a flurry of excitement around the possibilities of AI and though we are still in the early stages, we have begun to use text to speech in many of our learning packages and creative output.\u201d\n\nFrom Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, implementation programme manager Nickee Smyth\u00a0commented: \u201cThe digital healthcare team has been working tirelessly in 2023 to deliver an extensive list of requirements across the healthcare landscape. From multi-year ICS initiatives to system upgrades and EPR optimisations, the team has successfully integrated technologies and implemented digital enablers for large capital programmes, ensuring the best possible outcomes for patients. One of our greatest successes was our contribution to the Cheshire and Merseyside Surgical Centre, which received Getting it Right First Time accreditation. The team has been recognised with feedback stating that we are an exemplar hub, that is well led and full of innovation, specifically detailing the highly effective data sharing solution, which we implemented and that has become a blueprint for Cheshire & Merseyside.\n\u201cWe are also in the final stages of completing a significant network upgrade, which has included re-patching cables and migrating over 10,000 ports over 50 network locations across multiple sites, which has been extremely challenging. However, the team managed to complete this with minimal impact to end users, again resulting in the best possible outcomes for our staff and patients. Towards the latter end of the year, we completed the roll out of our digital CTG Solution. Close working with our clinical staff in maternity services proved vital for the success of the project which ensures that our services are delivered safely and effectively for all expecting parents.\u201d\n\nFrom South Yorkshire Primary Care Workforce & Training Hub,\u00a0an organisation providing training support for local practices and coordinating regional workforce and training schemes on behalf of NHS England,\u00a0project manager, greener NHS champion and NHS England clinical entrepreneur Liz Leggott highlighted their work testing digital learning tools and their effectiveness and appropriateness for primary care staff training. \u201cWe trialled about six suppliers, some had ready-made solutions to buy off the shelf, some were collaborations and some were created in partnership with suppliers from scratch,\u201d Liz shared.\n\u201cWe found that actually some of the ready-made solutions were not fit for primary care, we couldn\u2019t suspend belief enough to make them work for us and they were quite expensive. We also found that actually smaller companies who were looking for customers were very happy to offer a partnership approach and made us realise that actually we could potentially create an income down the line for the output, and we got something bespoke. Equally we found that with a bit of guidance and someone who knows their way around a 360 camera and Matterport, we could easily create something for not a lot of money that would do a great deal for us.\u201d\nA key learning was that \u201cwe had to use the technology as part of a face to face teaching session to get any engagement. Offering open access to a tool to people who don\u2019t have capacity for anything other than seeing patients, meant that there was very little uptake. It had to be a part of a planned session. So we did just that. We have now started to deliver training bolstered by the use of the Pico headsets and BodySwaps software and the use of our 360vr platform for induction and introduction to the general practice team and environment.\n\u201cThe reason for the testing was in part to see what tools we could adopt in the Training Hub but it was also to build up a business case for an Innovative technology led training and simulation centre, to prove the concept and to offer recommendations going forward. That business case and evaluation is now complete.\u201d\nDidi Craze, specialist communications midwife, shared insights from University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust. \u201cWe have four maternity units in our fairly newly merged trust (University Hospitals Sussex \u2013 which covers seven hospital sites in total), which serves over 10, 000 pregnant women and people and their babies. We have implemented maternity digital notes in our Chichester and Worthing sites this year, bringing them in line with Brighton and Haywards Heath sites, and there has been so much work by the maternity teams to join all our maternity services up and make them visible and accessible to parents.\n\u201cPart of my role, I organise and promote our regular staff listening events on Teams \u2013 a chance for staff from all four sites to drop in \u2013 even just for five mins with a cuppa and on their phone \u2013 meet staff from other work areas, get more familiar with the senior managers, hear updates on our services and key priorities as well as raise their own concerns and ask questions directly. This has helped break down the hierarchy barriers which can sometimes exist in large organisations as well as offering access to meetings to staff who may have struggled to travel or had childcare barriers to attendance.\n\u201cI have also been working on a project with the Director of Midwifery to implement a staff app which offers them a direct way to feedback their experiences on shift and their quality improvement project ideas.\u201d\nAaron Atkinson, associate director of business intelligence at NHS Arden & GEM\u00a0said: \u201cLinking any datasets is not without its challenges but bringing together different health and social care datasets, at a system and national level, has historically proved particularly challenging due to a whole range of factors from data quality to information governance requirements. In 2023, we have seen our projects in this area really start to come to fruition.\n\u201cNationally, the Adult Social Care Client Level Directions (ASCCLD) initiative now has 163 councils in England submitting mandatory data on a minimum quarterly basis, with 12 councils submitting monthly. This has already started to inform service delivery, for example managing patient flow through acute settings into community support, and provide new insights, such as understanding how unpaid carers can be better supported to prevent crises.\n\u201cAt a system level, we have worked in partnership with Mid and South Essex ICS to develop and deploy a system-wide strategic data and analytics platform. Athena brings together national and local data flows, including primary, secondary and social care, to enable patient-facing services to be planned and delivered in a completely different way. As well as enabling users from different organisations across the system to have simple and secure access to dashboards, analysts are encouraged to work collaboratively to develop and publish their own content. The Athena platform has now been implemented in four further ICSs and made available to all local authorities across the country. These are just two examples of what is possible with data when you establish a clear vision, use fresh approaches to engagement and utilise high quality programme management support.\u201d\nThe digital health team at Isle of Wight NHS Trust\u00a0shared that over the past 18 months, they have \u201crevitalised the ageing infrastructure within our trust through significant capital investment secured as part of the Our Investing in Our Future programme. This comprehensive update ensures that our systems are not only easily managed but also resilient and fault-tolerant.\u201d\nKey improvements include network enhancement, with replacement of core network infrastructure and wireless access points; dual fibre connections to all data centre rooms for network resiliency; and assurance of a quicker, fault-tolerant, and more secure network.\nWork has gone into back-up and storage solutions, a telephony system upgrade, firewall upgrade and WAN and HSCN enhancement. There has also been implementation of a new clinical virtual desktop infrastructure with single sign-on, a data centre refresh and real-time location tracking for medical devices and assets.\n\u201cAll these enhancements collectively improve the patient and end-user experience, laying the groundwork for future improvements,\u201d said the Isle of Wight team.\nThey added that the integration of SystmOne into the community division \u201chas been met with enthusiasm from community services, and our overall experience has been very positive.\n\u201cThe implementation of our new methodology for transformative clinical systems projects has proven to be a triumph. This approach has enabled us to comprehensively grasp service requirements through structured workstreams. The introduction of these new systems has not only showcased increased capacity but has also alleviated pressures on services and waiting lists. Furthermore, it has fostered a culture of division-wide collaboration, promoting unified ways of working across various services within the division. As a result, there has been a significant enhancement in information sharing throughout island-based services.\u201d\nMany thanks to all who contributed, and HTN wishes everyone a happy Christmas and new year!\nRelatedHealth tech supplier announces ground-breaking strides in\u2026HTN Now: Ideal Health on assessing digital maturity and\u2026Hywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes \u00a375m\u2026Interview: \"A digital nurse is still a nurse at heart\"\u2026Google Cloud announces updates to solutions to support\u2026HTN Now: OX.DH on how technology in fertility clinics can\u2026\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals introduces 3D heart replicas to support surgical interventions", "address": "https://htn.co.uk/2023/12/21/3d-heart-replicas-informed-decisions-on-surgical-interventions-in-leeds/", "content": "\nA biomedical engineer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) has created 3D heart replicas with the aim to support surgical interventions for patients with congenital heart defects.\nScans are taken of a patient\u2019s heart and turned into a 3D replica using computer-aided design; these designs can then be studied on the computer screen, or in augmented 3D using a VR headset. Clinicians can also request a 3D-printed model, or a model which \u201cfeatures a simulated intervention, such as a stent or a synthetic conduit\u201d, meaning they can better visualise and test surgical approaches prior to making a decision on the best intervention.\nIt is hoped that the\u00a03D heart replicas can help balance the risks and benefits of possible interventions, as well as offering the chance for less invasive options to be considered, with potential outcomes including \u201cfewer days spent in hospital, significantly quicker recovery times, and reduced risks compared to open heart procedures\u201d.\nOverseeing the approach is Lisa Ferrie, biomedical engineer and 3D planning service lead at LTHT. Lisa commented: \u201c3D modelling provides a detailed level of visualisation that a CT or MRI scan simply can\u2019t provide alone, and leads to safer procedures more suitable to the patient\u2019s individual needs. It\u2019s a relatively new field, but the potential of this work to improve patient outcomes is huge. More and more you are seeing biomedical engineers or other technical specialists brought in-house to start similar services elsewhere in the NHS.\u201d\nDr Vitor Ramos, consultant in adult congenital heart disease and cardiac MR at LTHT, added: \u201cThe 3D designs have a tremendous effect on the way we treat our patients as it provides us with a far better understanding of their anatomies, allowing us to shorten procedures and reduce complications, where appropriate.

In April 2022, these referrals began being received into our single point of access. When they came into the single point of access, they were triaged, and then they were directed to the correct services that would be able to meet the clinical needs of these patients.\u201d\nThe trust covers a population of around 750,000, with patients served by 116 GPs, and annually, GPs will refer around 50,000 patients a year for MSK-related conditions.\n\u201cWe found when we introduced our single point of access that we had a number of issues with the referrals that were coming in, including a lot of quality and safety issues,\u201d Rebecca shared. \u201cWe were having to reject a lot of referrals because they were illegible, because we didn\u2019t have enough information to be able to triage. For example, we didn\u2019t have investigation results like results of MRI scans or X-rays, and quite often patients were referred for non-MSK conditions.\n\u201cThis led to lots of inefficiency within the service \u2013 we calculated we were losing about eight hours a week of admin and clinical time within the triaging team, because of missing information within our referrals, and because we were having to send them back and then we were chasing GPs to try and get the correct information. Obviously this also posed problems for our primary care colleagues, because they were then having to resubmit these referrals. Patients were then delayed because of their referrals bouncing backwards and forwards between primary care and triage.\u201d\nThe journey through Rego implementation\nRebecca took us through how the trust\u2019s journey with Rego began.\n\u201cBack in November 2020, our then therapy manager won a scholarship on to the Digital Health London Pioneer Fellowship. Her project was to digitise the referrals coming in from primary care into our single point of access. She went through months of product reviews and requirements, had a business case approved in September 2021, and then Rego was procured at the end of 2021, which is when I joined the team.\n\u201cWe began to set up review groups, consisting of consultants, physios, primary care colleagues, as well as the team from NEC Rego, to start designing the clinical algorithms and the clinical pathways that would eventually sit behind Rego to allow for these referrals to come into the single point of access.\u201d\nThey went live in July 2022, Rebecca explained, and then had a period of time where they would accept a hybrid of Rego referrals and old paper-based referrals. However, from October 2022,\u00a0Rego has been mandated for all referrals coming into the single point of access. To date, the trust has received over 40,000 referrals via Rego into the single point of access for triaging.\nBefore Rego, about 25 percent of referrals were being rejected, Rebecca noted, and patients were being referred to the wrong service for treatment. \u201cIt was taking us two minutes on average to process a referral, as we\u2019d have to click in and out of multiple attachments to figure out the correct service for the patient, which meant there were long delays in triaging. Our primary care colleagues would take about five minutes to process a referral, which is a lot of clinical time. We found referrals would often be batched, so they weren\u2019t being sent off straight away, which meant even longer delays.\u201d\nBenefits and learnings from Rego implementation\n\u201cRego has definitely changed the way in which we can triage referrals, and how quickly we can triage referrals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now only have to reject about two percent of referrals, so it\u2019s quite a significant reduction. Time to process referrals has decreased by 50 percent, because Rego integrates with our patient administration systems to allow GPs to automatically upload investigation results for their patient, which means that it all comes through in one PDF, so we can review everything all in one attachment. It\u2019s much easier for us to be able to see, from a triaging perspective, what the patient has been referred for and what service the patient should be referred into.\n\u201cReferrals are now triaged within one day of receipt, so we\u2019re able to signpost patients to the correct service much more quickly to get their treatment started. From a GP perspective, it\u2019s now only taking them 100 seconds to be able to complete a referral, since Rego integrates with their patient administration systems and pulls across patient information; so it\u2019s not having to be filled in by a person, it\u2019s already all on the form, and they can upload their imaging results straight into Rego. Rego selects the correct service for the patient via ERS, so the GP just has to press \u2018submit\u2019, and it will send the referral straight through to the triaging service.\u201d\nRebecca shared that the trust is on target to save around 3000 hours of GP or first contact practitioner time every year \u2013 the equivalent of putting one GP back into the system. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great feedback from our FCP colleagues, who are finding it much more simple and straightforward to use,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s aiding them with the decision making process.\u201d\nWith regards to waiting lists, one aim was to help reduce the discharge to refer at first appointment, along with consultant to consultant referrals. \u201cFor our orthopaedic cohort of patients, discharge to refer at first appointments has decreased from 20 percent to 14 percent, which means that the patients are getting to the right service the first time,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cOn consultant to consultant referrals, our aim was to reduce this from 17 percent to 10 percent \u2013 we actually achieved a decrease to eight percent, so we\u2019ve already gone above where we were aiming to with the implementation of Rego. That\u2019s without having Rego mandated for every service and GPs still having direct access to these services.\u201d\nNeurosurgery colleagues are still tackling their COVID backlog, but even there Rebecca highlighted that the trust is finding that consultant to consultant referrals have reduced with the implementation of Rego. \u201cIf patients are referred by Rego, only eight percent of them are sent back to referral at first appointment, versus 21 percent for patients who aren\u2019t coming in via Rego. That tells us it\u2019s doing a good job of signposting these patients to the correct service the first time.\u201d\nFuture plans\nIn terms of financial recovery, the trust\u2019s hope is that as their waiting list decreases, this could lead to a shift of private sector activity back to NHS services. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will then lead to a saving of \u00a33 million over the next three years,\u201d Rebecca shared.\n\u201cOn collaborative innovation \u2013 how we\u2019re working better with our colleagues across the MSK pathway \u2013 this really has been a collaboration across all parts of our system for our patients. We\u2019re incorporating our community services, our GP colleagues and our secondary care colleagues both have oversight of our pathways and overall clinical algorithms, and everybody does have the voice to be able to make changes. We\u2019re in discussions with other specialties about introducing Rego for them, as we\u2019re hoping to see similar impacts on their consultant times as we have done for our orthopaedic colleagues. All GPs across all three boroughs are now using the same clinical pathways to refer patients, which means that patients have the same level of care and the same level of decision-making whichever GP they go to. Patients can now move seamlessly around the services as needed.\u201d\nIf they can switch off direct access altogether, Rebecca continued, \u201cwe would see even bigger improvements for patients, hopefully, but we do need to start looking at reviewing our workforce across these patient pathways. We\u2019ve actually seen an increase in the demand for these services, which is right for the patient, as they should be coming to these services first. But now we need to look at how the workforce can support these improvements that we\u2019re seeing for patients across these clinical pathways.\n\u201cChange isn\u2019t easy, and we still have a few issues from time to time, but we\u2019re getting there. These positive results do really help to be able to give a narrative that this is the best thing for our patient. Engagement is key, having people onside and having those champions within primary care really does make a difference. Our FCP colleagues have been great \u2013 they are using Rego more and more, and we\u2019re starting to use them as to help induct new staff into primary care when they come in, to show them how to use Rego. We\u2019ve used multiple forums to engage GPs, FCPs and their admin staff \u2013 we\u2019ve been to PCN meetings, we set up lots of MS Teams teaching sessions, and we also produced a video and PDF training guide that can be held within the PCN. So what we\u2019ve learned is that actually, promising improvements can be seen in a short period of time, and what we\u2019re hoping is that with continued future engagement, we can continue to see improvements that we\u2019re seeing already.\u201d\nMany thanks to Rebecca for joining us and sharing BHR\u2019s experiences.\nRelatedHywel Dda Local University Health Board publishes
