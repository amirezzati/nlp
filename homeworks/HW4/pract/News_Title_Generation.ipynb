[n] سرپرست مدیریت برنامه‌ریزی و توسعه شرکت ملی صنایع پتروشیمی با اشاره به برنامه‌های این شرکت برای مجتمع‌های پتروشیمی، گفت: ۲ برنامه برای مجتمع‌های پتروشیمی در دستور کار است؛ نخست تلاش می‌شود تولید مجتمع‌ها به ظرفیت اسمی برسند، دو اینکه از طرح‌های توسعه‌ای و ساخت واحدهای جدید با خوراک تولیدی خود مجتمع‌ها استقبال می‌شود و برای صدور مجوز اجرای آنها سختگیری نخواهد شد.\"\n","headline = generate_headline(article_text)\n","print(headline)\n","# سبد محصولات پتروشیمی متنوع می‌شود"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-13T17:56:03.919270Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-13T17:56:03.918626Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-13T17:56:04.178287Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-13T17:56:04.177431Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-13T17:56:03.919238Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["معرفی محصولات جانبی پالایشگاه هاشمی نژاد به کشاورزان\n"]}],"source":["article_text = \"به گزارش شانا به نقل از شرکت پالایش گاز شهید هاشمی‌نژاد، جمعی از کارشناسان این پالایشگاه با هدف معرفی محصول کود گوگرد بنتونیتی به کشاورزان در شانزدهمین نمایشگاه تخصصی کشاورزی، دام، طیور، ماشین‌آلات و صنایع وابسته در اردبیل حضور پیدا کردند و به معرفی دستاوردهای این شرکت پرداختند. [n] بر اساس این گزارش، دشت مغان قطب کشاورزی در منطقه اردبیل است و بیش از ۸۵ هزار هکتار زمین کشاورزی دارد که همه آنها نیاز به استفاده از کود گوگرد بنتونیتی دارند، به همین دلیل، کارشناسان پالایشگاه گاز هاشمی‌نژاد در راستای توسعه بازار و معرفی محصولات جانبی پالایشگاه (کود گوگرد بنتونیتی) به بازار داخلی در این نمایشگاه حضور یافتند. [n] شرکت در این نمایشگاه سبب شد تعداد زیادی از بازرگانان ایرانی فعال در حوزه گوگرد ضمن دیدار از غرفه شرکت پالایش گاز شهید هاشمی‌نژاد خواستار خرید محصول کود گوگرد بنتونیتی این مجتمع گازی شوند. [n] شرکت پالایش گاز شهید هاشمی‌نژاد در کنار رسالت اصلی خود مبنی بر تامین گاز مشترکان شمال و شمال شرق‌کشور، محصولات جانبی ارزشمند مانند گوگرد را تولید می‌کند، به گونه‌ای که اکنون با تولید روزانه بیش از ۲ هزار تن گوگرد مذاب، تولید روزانه ۶۰۰ تن گوگرد بنتونیتی (مطابق نیاز بازار) و تولید سالانه بیش از ۲۰ هزار تن گوگرد بنتونیتی، بزرگ‌ترین تولیدکننده گوگرد در کشور است.

[n] محسن عطارزاده ادامه داد: پالایشگاه سوم با بررسی دقیق شرایط عملیاتی در طول سال، کسب اطمینان از تولید پایدار گاز و قبول ریسک انجام فعالیتهای ضروری پیش از زمستان و همچنین با مد نظر قرار گرفتن حذف تعمیرات بالادستی (سکوهای پالایشگاه)، تصمیم به اجرا نکردن پروژه تعمیرات اساسی سال جاری گرفت تا در اقدامی آگاهانه و رو به جلو، رکورد تولید پایدار ۳۶۵ روزه خود را در سال جاری ثبت کند. [n] وی افزود: به این ترتیب پالایشگاه سوم پارس جنوبی در کنار حفظ تولید سالهای ۹۲ و ۹۳ که ضریب اطمینان ۹۹٫۹۷ درصدی را ارائه کرده است، در سال جاری علاوه بر ضریب اطمینان تولید، ضریب دسترس پذیری بالاتری را تثبیت می‌کند. [n] به گفته رئیس بهره برداری پالایشگاه سوم مجتمع پارس جنوبی، با حذف تعمیرات اساسی و تداوم ۱۷ روزه برداشت گاز از مخازن مشترک، تولید پالایشگاه نسبت به سال گذشته سه درصد افزایش خواهد داشت که درآمدی بیش از ۴۰۰ میلیارد تومان، معادل یک درصد بودجه عمرانی کل کشور را در بر می‌گیرد.
